Arrows allow you to subtract or add time while the microwave is in operation. tells you when to turn over food, when you're defrosting. extra large cooking capacity, and with the wrack it nearly doubles in size 1100 watts of power. the Bad it is incredibly heavy and bulky (nearly 70 pounds), have at least 2 strong men who can lift it when you install it. the door makes a loud clunking sound when it closes. there isn't a 'quick cook' button like GE had, the closest this has is EZOn, however that automatically defaults to 30 seconds the unit. doesn't constantly keep beeping to remind you that your food is ready. sometimes foods tend to get slightly soggy when taken off the 'hold warm' setting. the rotation cannot be turned off if it is set to keep warm. it's doing a number on my plastic dishes that are microwave safe, they're slightly bending, however since they're so inexpensive I do not mind too much. the Ugly it is a beast to clean/keep clean. it is a fingerprint/dust magnet picks up streaks very quickly. it can pick up scratches very, very easily. the Exceptional the Soften button allows you to soften butter, icecream, cream cheese and even frozen juice with the cooking sensors. the microwave cooks everything to the perfect temp and then shuts off automatically, this is great for TV dinners. with the Reheat button you can quickly heat up anything and the microwave will bring it to the perfect temp without any effort on your part dedicated. defrost settings for vegetables, beef and chicken with the Hold Warm button.

EZOn feature can be extended in 30 second increments just by pressing it. Custom Cook can be programmed to cook any single time you use the most often (my only complaint about this is you still need to press the Start/Enter button). Things to Remember never use a brillo pad or abrasive sponge on this as it could scratch very easily. although I don't know why you would want to, never turn the microwave oven on if nothing is inside it. when you first get it, sometimes it makes slight crackling sounds as it's in operation, these are normal when this arrives. it will look HUGE in the manufacturer's box, don't worry that's just how it looks in the box.

I was even able to put a Visions cookware pot in there without damaging the sides of the oven while the turntable is in motion which I thought I would not be able to do prior to receiving the oven. I did have a concern that I would not be able to use this particular pot in there because of damage it could cause. but I was pleasantly surprised I was able to put it in this oven If you own a lower wattage microwave oven and you purchase this one. you will also need to adjust your times by at least half the amount you already use on your current oven. I also love the minute plus setting, if you make a mistake in your time you can press this button to add one more extra minute. everytime until you reach the desired time, it is very handy if you are not sure just how much more time you need with your cooking and don't want to have to go all through the steps again to reset and start over. this button is so easy. just one press and you get an extra minute. I completely recommend this Microwave oven ot everyone, I just hope it last twenty years like my old Amana microwave did.\"\n",

    "        corrected = \"I have been sleeping on memory foam mattresses as soon as the knockoff ones were made. my parents and grandparents both have the expensive one that is advertised everywhere. but they have a larger budget than I do. .so I can tell you these mattresses are really evolving. that can be good and bad. technology can make things better for us, but sometimes things changing does not mean they are better. in fact sometimes they get worse. in this case, memory foam is evolving in a better way but the process to find the one for you is becoming more time consuming and frustrating. there are soooo many choices how do you know which foam is best?  1, 2 , 3 or 4 in?. gel infused?. regular foam?. 8,10 or 12 in?. I mean the choices are endless. and that is the part that gets to me. I spent nearly a total of 30 hours researching and comparing. and I know alot about these things. and it still took me that long. I can tell you my grandfather told me when I was a kid something I never forgot he said 'you spend 1/3 of your life sleeping, so you should make sure you find a good bed, it will help determine the quality of your life, health and happiness, so don't skimp on a good bed!'  He was right. but what is a good bed?  That is really up to each person. Here is what I did this time looking for a new mattress. 1.  Went to a mattress store.  Laid down on nearly all the mattresses and took notes.  I already knew I wanted a higher thickness like 12 inch, but I wanted to test the new gel infused beds, the latex beds and the expensive ones. then I tried the knockoffs. and wrote down my findings. I know sounds bizarre, but it works for me. it would not work for my husband he would just go in and buy the first one that felt good and we would have ended up spending nearly $2000.00 instead of $300.00. so that is why I go alone!!2.  I came home and did a search for 'what to know when buying a memory foam mattress.'  What this did is give me all the current information on the type of foams they are making now and what the specs are (what is the difference between a 3 inch and 4 inch foam?. what  is the difference between a 10 inch and 12 inch bed?. differences between densities of foam?). This them helped me determine that I wanted a bed to last longer than many beds, I need a firm bed for my back, hips, shoulders and knees, I wanted something that would keep the firmness yet provide support and be comfy. sounds like I wanted everything. oh yeah. and not break the bank!!. I learned that the higher the bed, the more likely it will last longer, the thicker the top layer of foam is with a density of at least 9, the longer the memory foam will stay firm. 3.  Now that I knew the type of bed I was looking for (firm, 12 inch height, 4 inch first layer of foam with a density of at least 9). .I went to Amazon to see what they had for sale. I found several. I then narrowed them down by price. from $200500. among these I looked at the reviews. and just because many people have purchased an item and it has several good reviews does not mean that is the best mattress. actually this one had the fewest people purchase it but the highest reviews out of those few people. so, now I had about 3 beds that me this criteria. 3.  I checked online in a search to find out the best memory foam mattresses consumer reports and other entities have put on the web, and found a few that matched up with the ones I had found on Amazon. .however, none of them matched up with this one. nearly all those other beds were higher in price, did not have the density I was looking for or were not 12 inches. 4.  So, out of all the beds, I had 3 to choose from, I looked on other sites to compare prices and I can tell you Amazon beats everyone hands down. even the big discount retailer (wally world). where I have purchased mattresses from before, did not compare to Amazon in terms of price or shipping time. .So why this mattress?. I can tell you that the 12 inch provides all the support I need and the longevity I am looking for. this mattress was one of the few on Amazon that actually states the density (which is critical to knowing how firm it really is). and I also checked the company's website to verify the firmness. and the 4 inch top layer with and ILD 9 (density). proved it was going to be firm and stay firm for years. my husband lives in a different state and his memory foam mattress is only a 3 inch and 7 ILD and we got it about 2 years ago and its starting to sag already. and he is not even a very big guy. so that will be the lst 3 inch 7 ILD that I buy. .AND as a BONUS. this mattress was only $254.99 on Amazon. with free shipping. I mean you just cannot beat it. most ILD 9 / 4 in. foam mattresses start at $500 and go way above. After this got delivered ahead of schedule, it came in rolled up in a large what appeared to be a duffle like bag.  Easy to open and immediately started taking shape.  I can tell you that nearly all my other mattresses have had the 'horrible' chemical smell for weeks after opening. but this one had about a day of it and it was gone. no more smell. that was nice. I did let it take shape for 3 days prior to sitting or laying on it. its important to do this so you do not impede on its taking full shape. if you lay on it too soon, you may see a sag in that part and it may never come to its full size. I know when you get something you want to use it right away. but you need to allow these to take full shape. it says 2 days, but I always allow for another full day. I would also recommend as others did, you open it up where you want it placed. once it has taken shape its not so easy to move unless you have help. and there are NO mattress handles on the side like other mattresses. Also, in terms of memory foam being 'hot' to sleep on. I sleep 'hot' myself and I have not noticed this is any hotter than any other mattress I have ever slept on. I have tshirt sheets and a thin blanket for summer, but I do not feel this gets hot at all. all memory foam will sink when it gets warm, but even by me sleeping 'hot' this one still stays firm. and its August so you know if it works in August, it will work in any other time of the year. August in Idaho is HOT!!!. .when I tried the gel infused mattresses or the ones that have multi layers with air cylinders that 'they claim will allow the foam to breathe better and air to flow through so you will not get so hot'. I found several places online that say that is just not true. and I did not notice any difference when I was trying out the beds at the stores. it is important that you have cotton sheets and cotton pillow cases because cotton is cooler than raymee, rayon, polyester, etc. I can ASSURE you. this is the BEST OF ALL MEMORY FOAM MATTRESSES I have EVER OWNED!!!. it is exactly what they say it is Firm yet soft. It provides ALL the support I need. yet it cradles you. I don't toss or turn, yet I don't sink either. great price. and quick shipping. NOT ALL MEMORY FOAM IS THE SAME. .so take the time to do the research for your own body. as I would never prescribe this bed for everyone, I know what I like and need, and this one is it for me!!. making sure you do your research BEFORE buying really pays off. Going to buy another for our camper. UPDATE 8/22/2013:  Someone asked me a question about the firmness of this mattress and the different weights of people. I can tell you I did respond in the comments section but I thought I would also put the response here. I weigh around 200 lbs and my husband less. so, I really needed a firm mattress for my body weight. if I lay on a bed that has no support I can tell you my hips, shoulders and back hurts like heck. so, this mattress fully supports me at my weight. some people that weigh less have complained in online reviews they feel the mattress is TOO FIRM. but my husband I believe weighs around 155 and he never has complained. he does have his own mattress (since he lives in Nebraska for work purposes and I live in Idaho). his mattress is not as dense of foam and that mattress is sinking already. he complains about his back hurting some mornings. he too likes a firm mattress. so when he visited me in Idaho last week and slept on this mattress, he thought it was GREAT!. even if he weighs less than me. as I said, he said too that this mattress even if its firm, its comfy. strange but true. I also wanted to point out an issue that I forgot in my initial posting. memory foam mattresses react different in different climates. for example. I have lived in Hawaii where the humidity is higher than it is in Idaho. and in a climate that is more humid the mattress will absorb that moisture and be less firm. this is why I felt its even more important to get a mattress with a higher density so it will stay firmer even in high humidity areas. I can tell you if I turn on my humidifier in Idaho, this particular mattress is NOT affected by the level of humidity. it still has remained firm yet comfy. again I believe this is due to the density of the top layer of foam. the higher the density the more firm it will remain. the less dense, the more it will allow moisture in and absorb it making it softer. .the last time I was in Nebraska visiting my husband and I slept on our older foam bed there, I woke up and thought my back was broken. I kid you not. I was miserable all day. its so humid back in Nebraska and the memory foam mattress he has is not as dense or thick. so it really absorbed the moisture in the air and was way too soft for me. I sank into it and my back suffered the entire next few days. the next night I slept on the couch and the firmness of the couch was better than the softness of the bed in that humid climate. STILL LOVIN THIS BED. ordering one for hubby soon and our camper!!!UPDATE 9/2/2013:COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Someone emailed me in the comment section and asked where this mattress was manufactured.  It says Country of Origin is China.  I would love to purchase USA products too, however, I learned years ago that even thought something says 'Made in the USA' it maybe put together here with materials from all over the world.  I did research beds that have been 'Certified' Made in the USA, and they either did not have the density of this mattress but were still way out of my price range.  I did also run into some of the Made in the USA mattresses that cannot guarantee the chemicals they spray on the mattress to be in compliance with the fire standards, come from the USA. so, I had to prioritize my wants and needs and what was most important to me was 1) comfort (being firm enough), 2) price and 3) as many nontoxic materials.  I did read a few people said there was not a horrible smell like other memory foam mattresses, and in my research, that is a good sign of fewer chemicals in the mattress. WARRANTY:  With respect to the warranty, I don't pay too much attention to those anymore, after the horror stories I learned about people trying to file a claim under a warranty. Not to mention the cost of returning it to the manufacturer is the buyers cost. That is why I wrote my initial posting, it really is all about the denseness of the foam. The more dense the foam the longer it will last. irrespective of the warranty. UPDATE 2/21/2014:We purchased another one of these for my husband who lives temporarily in the midwest for work.  Its very humid where he lives.  We have not noticed any difference in the mattress even with it being in a more humid climate in the midwest.  We are still very happy with these mattresses. I would remind those people looking to purchase or those who have purchased one prior, to make sure you place this mattress on a firm foundation/box spring.  They are not made to sit atop something that is not firm.  We did not have access to our boxspring one night and we placed this on top of another (spring) mattress so we did not have it on the floor directly.  However, after just a few hours, we noticed a significant difference in the firmness of the mattress. It became uneven and we sank into it.  Once we put it on the floor directly, it was fine and firm again. Also, we took off the cover and washed it.  It really washed up nicely.  I had one mattress before that when I dried the cover in the dryer, it shrank so small that I could not get it to fit the mattress anymore.  This cover did NOT do that.  It stayed the same size and went back on easy.\"\n",

Also, it seems to me like most people who use slow cookers use it as a lazy cook tool, with prepackaged products and just throwing everything together, which to me makes the food extremely unattractive. Recently, though, I have been making lots of soups and stews, so I thought maybe it was time to consider getting a slow cooker. After lots of research, which included reading some slow cooking books and lots of reviews both on books and cookers, I decided to get this one. Of course, I was a little concerned about the issues mentioned on reviews, that the cooker shuts itself off, but I really liked the probe feature. So I made the purchase and hoped for the best. When the box arrived, it was big! I immediately thought I might not want to keep something so huge in my kitchen. Fortunately, there were actually two boxes, plus the original box it comes in, so the actual cooker wasn't as gigantic as I first thought, which was nice.

Lawry's garlic saltblack pepper1 teaspoon full of 'Better Than Boullion'.  beef1 cup of Marsala wine Pat the roast dry and season it. with the seasonings to taste, leave the bay leaves aside Slice the garlic and, on a large skillet, brown the slices in the olive oil Remove the garlic slices with a slotted spoon and reserve. Add the bacon to the skillet and fry the pieces until they're crunchy and all the fat has melted from the pieces, remove all the bacon with a slotted spoon and reserve Make sure the oil is hot and bring the roast to the skillet, browing all sides, but being careful so the seasonings don't get burned on the bottom of the pan (mine did). Place the carrots on the bottom of the pot of the slow cooker, add the bay leaves, and place the browned roast on top Lower the heat and add the peeled pearl onions to the skillet, rolling them on the pan from time to time, for about 2 to 3 minutes Add the wine and stir, scrapping the 'burnt' areas with a wooden spoon to incorporate that to the wine. Add the beef concentrate (Better Than Boullion). Stir the contents until the concentrate has been dissolved into the liquids. Place the potatoes around the roast in the slow cooker, then pour the contents of the skillet on top of it. Sprinkle the garlic and bacon on top of everything. Turn on the slow cooker, add the lid, place the probe into the meat, making sure it sits right in the middle of it, plug the probe into the cooker, set the temperature to 160 degrees and the cooking temperature to low. Open the cooker after about 3 to 4 hours, lift the roast and stir everything else on the bottom of the pan, then place the roast back on top, add the brussels sprouts around the roast, replace the lid and probe, and allow the cooker to finish its cycleI was pleasantly surprised with the texture of the vegetables, as well as how moist the meet was. My thought was that things would turn out more like what I get when I cook using a pressure cooker, but that is not so. The carrots didn't fall apart and had a nice, firm, texture. So did the potatoes. The brussels sprouts were a tad overcooked for me, but I like them very firm and had added them after only 2 hours of cooking, so with the adjusted time it shouldn't be an issue, and they weren't mushy. Next time, I will marinade the pork for 24 hours using all the seasonings and lemon juice prior to browning it and make sure there is no seasoning on it when I do so, this should make it look nicer. A photo of this first meal made in the cooker is being posted. It was also very nice to find out that the cooker didn't turn itself off during the cooking process. I'll keep an eye and add updates here if it starts doing that, but this first time it worked really well and I was impressed with the results. I already have a beef roast in the freezer that is the next in line to try my new toy out with. At some point, I may try to brown the meat in the grill instead of on the stove, to see if it makes a difference in flavor. I'll probably also try that using the smoker, or charcoal grill to see what happens. So many possibilities, how exciting!Regarding other things I read about the cooker, I really think that the person who had trouble closing the lid was probably doing something wrong. Some people wrote about the lid, or insert, breaking. They seem pretty sturdy to me. Of course, anything that's made out of glass or ceramic will break if you hit it hard, or if it falls from a good distance onto a hard surface. I don't really believe they will break if handled properly and with proper care. If I remember, I'll take a picture and post it here. All things considered, me like!  :)Enjoy!\"\n",

Fist bed cost with cover $1000 second bed with me buying the cover myself altogether was $460. watch out for those franchises that try to get you for as much as they can.

Allen wrench to tighten them down (additional tools required  hammer and pliers to coax then get enough lever arm on the Allen wrench to turn it), eventually all of the bolts were attached and the arms and back were fully installed (one stripped bolt during the process, glad to have the spare). the last step was cosmetic, inserting the silver caps over the bolts, ultimately unsuccessful for all except one, the rest are just so much silvery scrap plastic as they were also too small for the aluminum ferules (now you might wonder, as I did, if I somehow got things backwards, but the arms were marked L and R and the thin portion of the arms is attached to the chair back as expected and in the only way that might fit, if there was an issue it was that the ferules were installed incorrectly at the factory) overall time to assemble 45 minutes, more than I would have expected. As far as operation, the chair moves and adjusts appropriately, and is comfortable enough for the overall quality, but the assembly was well over the top for difficulty. I, also, have to question the 'leather' descriptor, from my experience, the look and feel is at worst pleather and at beast artificial leather (here's a link to Wiki:[...] ). The arms are fixed, as is apparent from the product picture. The only adjustments available are to the height and tilt of the chair. This is a basic, economical office chair, the price is comparable to what I might find in the local office supply store. Three stars is the best I can offer. P)\"\n",

    "        corrected = \"After 16 months of using the Keurig I feel I can speak out with all honesty. First it's another gadget that you think you can't live without ,it appears to be a miracle ,and it is well built. BUT !! after a year I'm starting to question why I bought it. First you fill the machine with water ,you press the button which heats the water ,then lift the lid put your kcup in ,close the lid and press 468 cups thats all there is to it. It makes decent coffee but not outstanding. First you are limited to the companies that market their coffee in kcup format at a stiff price. What happens next in a lot of cases is you start realizing the coffee is not cheap ,so you start looking for ways around buying kcups ,and there are a few. Read my reviews about Ekobrew ,solocup etc and you get the picture. First ask yourself why did I buy the Keurig ,well you wanted convenience and no clean up. Well with convenience comes cost as stated ,so you buy some brew cups like Ekobrew and you pack in your favorite brew ,then comes the clean up of the cup ,a messy job unless you buy the solofil which you have to buy filters. So if you have a cup a day it will cost around $48 or more a year if you have a few more cups a lot more. Your choice, mostly lousy expensive coffee with convenience or great coffee for less money but more inconvenience. I come back to when I had a Cuisinart 4 cup coffee maker that all I had to was wash the carafe and filter holders BUT !! I had the best coffee available from any gourmet shop or country. I'm tired of the cleanup which is a little messy and am starting to miss my Cuisinart. It seems most buyers of Keurig are smitten with the technology but not the price of the Keurig and the coffee pods , so start looking for alternatives. That's not why you bought the Keurig. 2/18/2013I've finally had it with this machine ,I will finish up the dozen or so kcups I got left. This is a money making machine for someone, a lot like color printers, you buy them cheap and you pay through the nose for ink. The big difference is the Keurig is expensive and so is the coffee, at least 50c85c and sometimes more per cup. It has become such a profit machine for Green Mountain that even Staples is carrying kcups ,apparently there is some serious money to be made selling these kcups. So if you read my reviews about people being so turned off by how much the coffee costs are buying work arounds such as Solo Cups ,Ekobrew etc. And as I have stated many times you give up convenience to save money on coffee but have the cleanup that you tried to avoid by buying the Keurig. Well today I went on Amazon after a lot of research and ordered the Hamilton Beach Scoop. I wish I had done more research before I got myself locked into this Keurig. The Hamilton Beach around $59 instead of $169 I paid for the Keurig allows me to scoop out my coffee in a scopp which is also the filter ,there is no carafe ,you just put your cup under the spout. It looks to me that clean up is just shaking out the grounds into the trash and rinsing. Well all those people who bought Keurig and are using the Ekobrew (like myself)paid 3 times as much for those features they don't use anymore in the Keurig,and there quite a few. My big beef is you really have to search online and pay postage to buy coffee you might like ,and I stress coffee that YOU MIGHT LIKE,most stores don't carry all the different coffees. I have found in my case the coffee I truly love doesn't come in a kcup ,so I buy a bag of coffee that I like and use the Ekobrew. So why did I spend so much for a gadget that restricts my choice of coffee when I could have just bought a 4 cup coffee maker and did the clean up like I'm doing right now whith my Keurig. Cleanup with these workarounds are messy ,hard to fill and if you read some reviews, coffee pours out of the sides so people have been inserting rubber washers to eliminate spillage. Yes I have been taken in by a gadget that takes up quite a bit of counter space. My wife is already cheering that the Keurig is on it's way out ,and so am I. What a waste and for only so so coffee ,I guess I learned the hard way. I will see what I can get for it on Ebay ,not much if someone reads my review. Also now that Green Mountain has come up with a more expensive Keurig type coffee maker that won't accept these Kcups ,a whole new system that locks you into Green Mountain and their coffee ,a sleek machine but not much better than the Keurig. I urge everyone to think this out before you buy this machine ,it's just not worth it. Another thing ,after a while you will start looking to buy a kcup holder ,that's a stand that holds about 16 kcups. This will set you back around $26 ,and then you might buy one of these filters ,little plastic containers to put your own coffee into it and save paying for kcups another $15.So you paid $149 + $9 tax so by the time you get through close to $200 and quite a bit of counter space. I bet in 6 months all these fell in love reviews will turn to what ever possessed me to buy this ?I can hear the echo already ,a marvel yes but who needs it ?2/26/2013My Keurig has a bidding war which ends tomorrow on Ebay. Well in the mean time I bought the Hamilton Beach Scoop ,it's also on it's way back to Amazon. Yes 90% + loved it BUT!! it made luke warm ,very weak coffee and after 2 days trying different coffee preheating the water,putting in 8oz of water and getting back 6oz of coffee ,I went out and bought the Cuisinart 4 cup coffee maker that I started off with for $29. FINALLY I'M FREE TO DRINK GOOD HOT COFFEE. Oh Cuisinart why did I ever leave you ,I will never complain about cleanup again. WHAT A LESSON I LEARNED.\"\n",

I only have one and it worked well for me. it only takes 57 minutes to bake a dozen of these. and when you do try this out. use a piping bag to put the batter into the mold. it will make this fast and easy and your product will look professional. the first donut I baked was the chocolate cake donut. the recipe comes along with the the pan. I found the donut to be too dense. I recommend a 1/2 teaspoon more of baking powder. but I found other recipes on the internet and my favorite recipe so far is the basic recipe that comes with the wilton donut pan. it puffs up  and the donut texture is perfect. I put a little melted butter on the tops and rolled the donut in cinnamon sugar. these were awesome. the pan performs really well. after a few minutes of cooling the donuts come out with ease. a wonderful pan to work with. not using oil to deep fry makes this a healthier alternative as well. and I like the mini size. they are so cute. I made  a few batches and took some to an early morning bantam hockey game. the young athletes and Moms and Dads ate them all up. I think you will enjoy this pan.\"\n",

I bought this a few months ago and have given it a fair shot, and this pan makes me so mad, and not after all foods. I mean for frying hamburger meat its fine, doing a grilled cheese sandwich yeah it good. my problem is that I do eggs a couple times a week, and regular fried eggs are even okay, but when I do scrambled eggs, I have to soak this pan for 2 days. to get the little circle grooves on the bottom of the pan clean, and that is what makes me hate this pan, yeah I could just get a different pan to do the eggs, but I want one pan to do all. I do in home childcare and cook everyday morning noon and night at home. really I think if this pan didn't have the groves on the bottom, it would be fine, but it is definately not comepltely nonstick. eggs are my biggest test of nonstick, and it failed. I follow every rule of the pan as well. I never cook over med heat, I always heat it up with a small amount of oil wiped on it. I never use metal, and some of the coating is chipping off as well. Now I do believe they stand behind their product, and they say if ever some of the coating comes off, they will replace it, but I don't find it worth replacing.\"\n",

    "        corrected = \"Some of the dining room chairs from the set purchased by my parents were sadly worn and I decided to buy these Armen chairs.. oddly enough, although I ordered two sets on the same day, the first set was delivered by FedEx. they are a neutral cream color and fit nicely with any d&eacute;cor.. I did find that the seat height is higher than my old dining room chairs so I (5' 3') have to sit towards the front of the seat in order to have my feet flat on the floor.. however, my son is happy as at 5' 11', he can take full advantage of the lumbar support of the tall chair back. Unfortunately, the second set of chairs was delivered by UPS.. I gather that FedEx put the box containing the chairs in a larger cardboard box and while one side of the outside box was ripped, the box inside was not damaged at all.. UPS just delivered the chairs in their original packing box and that was ripped in several places. when we moved the box into my living room, I could hear tinkling and when we opened the box, the bolts, washers and locks needed to assemble the seat and chair legs to the chair back were all over the inside of the box as the bag containing these articles had been slit.. we gathered all the pieces and apparently some had fallen out through the rips in the packing box.. I then had to go to a specialty fastenings store when Home Depot said they didn't carry these items (for anyone having the same problem, they are metric).. so after that hassle, we started assembling the second set of chairs when I noticed that the top of one chair back was torn. so, ended up having to rebox up all of the second set and just shipped them back (NEVER ask for a replacement. they will make you pay the shipping costs to return the item!). I will update once the new set arrives. hopefully the second set will be delivered by FedEx and not UPS!Update 11/15/13. I've had to lower my rating down to two stars because this whole situation has been a trial. it was quite a hassle to get a free return shipping label for the second set of chairs. I did it on the chat route and the first person said I wouldn't have to pay for the return shipping and then sent me a shipping label which said that I would have to pay the return shipping cost!. I went on the chat site again and the second person said no problem, sent me a link to the free return shipping label. repacked everything and took it down to UPS and sent the chairs back. Then the third (replacement) set arrived yesterday evening. I decided to wait until this morning to open the box and lo and behold, there is a 5' stain on one of the chair seats. whoever packed it left a piece of oilstained tape stuck to the chair seat and I wasn't able to get the stain off. so I went online to the chat site again and this time, I wasn't able to get a free shipping label although I was told that I would be refunded the FULL cost of returning this set of chairs (I live in Hawaii and the amount that Amazon says they will refund you for shipping is nowhere close to the actual cost of what it costs to send these large items back) So I now only have two chairs and although I really like them, I don't know about submitting to another round of this. I am now trying to see if I can cancel the Smartgard protection plan I purchased for this second set of chairs since I don't seem to be able to get a set without any damage or defect. I guess I'll have to recover the seats of my old dining chairs and when I have the energy to deal with this hassle again, I MIGHT consider trying to reorder another set of chairs. if I have any problems with getting my full shipping costs refunded, there's no way I will order any large items from Amazon again!Update 11/30/13. Packed up the second set of chairs and was on my way down to the FedEx center on Saturday morning to send them back when I saw an email that had just come in on my phone that morning from the Amazon returns department that they had arranged to have UPS come to my home and pick up the box!! The UPS driver picked up the box the following Monday and I've since been notified that the set arrived and my refund will be credited to my account.. For that reason, I have upgraded my rating to three stars. So, decided to order two sets of chairs this time around and hoping that all goes well. it would be nice to have a full set of matching chairs for my dining room!\"\n",

    "        corrected = \"It has good suction, seems functional but not an outstanding vacuum. You can't vacuum under furniture because the plastic container that you empty is to big. The cord does not stretch out straight enough so you have to contend with the cord curling. I find I have to empty the plastic container after each vacuuming, and when you press the button to rewind the wire it sometime wont rewind all the way. It is quite powerful and I find a lot of the carpet fibers in the container,still for $104 it is a good buy. I had an older Panasonic with bags, had to clean out the filter and make sure the bag wasn't full. It had started to shutdown because it overheated. I think vacuum cleaners have become a throwaway item, no point fixing them at this price. 4/21/2014An update the darn thing shut down. My wife empties it each time, but as I took it apart I found it hopelessly clogged. I had to take the plastic enclosure down to my workbench to pull out this clear plastic insert which was jammed with fiber. After tapping with a hammer for 20 minutes it came apart spewing dust all over my clothes. I washed all the parts which come apart including the filter. I have come to the conclusion, it is not worth the aggravation to try to save on bags. If you have allergies, you don't want this machine. I am reducing the stars because all vacuums suck but this one sucks in other ways you might not appreciate.\"\n",

I bought two of the curtains  and it makes it look luxurious  in particular when you have an older bathroom.  my home is over  nearly 55 years old  and the bathroom while fixtures are newer.  it is smaller  the other bathroom much larger  but the white gives it a brightness which seems to expand size of same.

Everything I have made has come out fabulous. I finally retired my old stainless steel pressure cooker after 15 years and the difference between my Instant Pot and the old way of pressure cooking is like day and night. The old one I just realized turned everything into mush ( various soups) after around 20 minutes or less of required cooking and I was used to it but the 6 in 1 is so much better. Thus far I have steamed asparagus amd artichokes to perfection, as well as brussel sprouts, potatoes and pears. I made chicken soup (with the regular soup setting) as well as Greek Lentil soup last night, and all have been delicious. with soft vegetables that still had definition to them, not all mushed up. the only problem I experienced thus far was charring a pork roast and the bottom of the pot was burned but after soaking and cleaning with Bartenders Friend it cleaned up perfectly. This was my fault and it will not happen again. I look forward to using it. I noticed in the recipe book mostly all the recipes are times in the Manual setting, but thus far the soup setting works great for all types of soup. I use the manual settings for the vegetables and fruits. Anyway, the bottom line is I am very happy with this purchase and hope it will continue producing great meals!!!\"\n",

      "Paul Harvey was a great man.  He was a pioneer in radio broadcasting especially in regard to the talk radio genre.  He was a decent person.  One of the \"good guys.\"  In 2005, President George W. Bush awarded Mr. Harvey the Presidential Medal of Freedom.  And  recently he passed away. But even great men have flaws.  Paul Harvey had been quoted as saying, \"I am fiercely loyal to those willing to put their money where my mouth is.\"  And therein, lies a conflict of interest. Now, I have no way of knowing whether or not Mr. Harvey knowingly endorsed fraudulent products but it is utterly indisputable that he did endorse the main product of Suarez Corporation Industries. You undoubtedly have never heard of SCI but if you were a regular or even semiregular listener of Paul Harvey you would have heard him endorse the miraculous EdenPURE heater with its revolutionary \"cured copper\" heat exchanger. SCI is a prime supplier to the multilevel marketing community.  Some of the companies that make up SCI are: Biotech Research International Home Shopping Lindenwold Fine Jewelers U. S. Commemorative Gallery Biotech Medical, LLC Resource PartnersThis list is a smorgasbord of overpriced, yet intensely crappy products.  (Oh sure, they sell the TempurPedic line of closed cell foam mattresses which are merely overpriced...you can pick up the exact same thing at Walmart for a fraction of their cost.)  This company is a virtual feeding frenzy for multilevel marketing scammers. But I am only going to focus on their most prominent scam product:  The EdenPURE heater. The EdenPURE heater is the most expensive 115volt electric space heater money can buy, bar none, and it is marketed with, at best, halftruths and, at worst, blatant lies. Compounding the problem is literally hundreds (if not thousands) of independent distributors, many of them not authorized resellers. So lets get into the meat of the issue.  Just what does CSI, through its Biotech Research subsidiary, claim that the EdenPURE can do?  Here are some select pickings from their FAQ page:Q. What is the EdenPURE Heater Quartz Infrared Heating System?A. Our Heating System is a revolutionary zone furnace that safely and efficiently heats entire areas that need additional heat. Translation:  It's a portable electric space heater. Q. How do the EdenPURE Quartz Infrared Portable Heaters Work?A. With the advent of microelectronic technology and the latest in infrared commercial quartz tubes, three solar copper furnaces inside the unit absorb the heat from these tubes much like a sponge absorbs water. The patent pending process of cured natural copper creates an innovative heat exchanger capable of absorbing heat like a solar sponge. It then safely exhales what is coined as \"soft\" environmentally friendly heat that is able to travel rapidly in relative humidity. The EdenPURE SOFT heat does not burn up the humidity; moreover, it employs the humidity as a vehicle to warm up large spaces quickly and efficiently. EdenPURE heater has perfectly regulated heat that will not destroy life/energy that other dangerous portable heating devices destroy, but helps to maintain healthy humidity levels indoors. Other heaters cause occupants to lose energy and force them to breathe dry uncomfortable air. The EdenPURE heater replicates the earth's sun process by electronically exhaling comfortable cost cutting heat without burning up your family's life sustaining oxygen in your indoor living space. The benefits of this natural solar process are revolutionizing the way we will heat our homes and help save large amounts of costly energy. Translation:  Let the BS begin.  Taking it itembyitem: Microelectronic technology.  Translation:  It has a digital thermostat. The latest in infrared commercial quartz tubes.  Translation:  Three 500watt halogen light bulbs.  Big woop. Three solar copper furnaces.  Translation:  Copper pipe cut to length that surround the light bulbs. Cured natural copper.  Translation:  Fairy dust & unicorn farts.  There is no such thing as \"cured\" copper. It then safely exhales.  Translation:  It has a blower.\"Soft\" environmentally friendly heat.  Translation:  More fairy dust. Does not burn up humidity.  Translation:  Utter nonsense, heaters don't dehumidify. Will not destroy life/energy.  Translation:  Utter nonsense for the mentally challenged. Helps to maintain healthy humidity levels.  Translation:  Utter nonsense, totally impossible. Other heaters cause occupants to lose energy.  Translation:  We think you are stupid. Replicates the earth's sun process.  Translation:  We think you are really, really stupid. Electronically exhales.  Translation:  We are doubling down on the stupid thing. Without burning...oxygen.  Translation:  Just in case you are an absolute idiot we are tossing this one in out of sheer spite. Helps save large amounts of costly energy:  Translation:  Compared to what?  Plutonium?Now back to the FAQ's...Q. What makes the EdenPURE Heater \"Healthier\" than other heaters?A. For one... the EdenPURE heater does not produce positive ions like other blower (dryer) type heaters. EdenPURE heater has perfectly regulated heat that will not destroy life/energy that other dangerous portable heating devices destroy, but helps to maintain healthy humidity levels indoors. Since the early 1950s scientists have suspected that ions play an important role in how the body functions and, consequently, in how we feel. Research has shown that an abundance of negative ions in the air we breathe is highly beneficial. Conversely, scientists have found that if the air is charged with too few negative ions and too many positives, we become anxious, fatigued and tense. Positive ion poisoning has, in fact, been linked to heart attacks, aggravated asthma, migraine headaches, insomnia, rheumatism, arthritis, hay fever, and most allergies. Translation:  Wow.  This is industrial strength BS at its finest.  To me, this is holistic, pseudoscience mumbo jumbo that is ridiculous and claiming that other heaters produce positive ions is utter rubbish thrown out there for the slowwitted. Q. How does the comfort of the EdenPURE Heater System compare to other systems?A. The EdenPURE Heater System is a state of the art system that provides the most comfortable form of heat. Unlike traditional systems, which may leave a differential of up to 18 degrees from floor to ceiling, the EdenPURE Heater System heated air, using infrared absorption, does not concentrate near the ceiling. Heat stays down and evenly dispersed in the area where you and your family live. Temperature difference from floor to ceiling is minimal. In addition, the EdenPURE Heater System does not remove humidity from the air. It actually helps maintain humidity levels. The even heating and higher humidity permit lower heat settings with more comfort, less condensation on windows and less static electricity. Furthermore, the EdenPURE Heater System does not use flame, fuel or any form of combustion. Therefore, the heat from the EdenPURE Heater is safe and clean  free of any other type of pollution and does not use up the oxygen in the air. Translation:  Okay, well this is more crap served up with a very large spoon...maybe even with a funnel and a hose. The EdenPURE is, despite claims to the contrary, a forced air electric space heater.  There is nothing magical about what it does.  Room temperature air comes in one end and higher temperature air comes out the other end.  That's it. Warm air rises due to a property in air called \"convection.\"  To minimize the natural process of convection the air in a room may be  circulated.  Ceiling fans do this quite nicely. There is no heater made that removes humidity from air.  It is a physical impossibility.  Period.  To remove humidity from air one must lower the air temperature below its dew point.  This is called condensation.  Think of the \"sweat\" that occurs on a glass of ice water.  If  water condenses on the inside of your windows it is because there is a source of excess humidity in the house...someone left the shower running...and the glass is below the dew point.  The EdenPURE heater is totally incapable of maintaining ANY level of humidity.  Winter air is dry.  Go to NOAA and look it up. Any properly installed heating system will not use up the oxygen of the occupied space.  Again, nothing magical here. Q. Economically, how does the EdenPURE Heater System compare to other systems?A. The EdenPURE Heater System is the most economical way to heat. In Midwestern Utility field tests for heating seasons, the EdenPURE Heater used an average of 35% less energy than conventional electric furnace/baseboard systems. Comparable results were found during comparisons with fuel based heating systems. Individual results, of course, depend on insulation values, local climate, and other conditions. Translation:  This is a pure lie.  The most economical way to heat using electricity is with a heat pump.  So, yeah, individual results depend on \"other conditions.\"  These (along with that old favorite, \"individual results may vary\") are what are called \"weasel words.\"Q. How much area does a EdenPURE Heater System Heat?A. The EdenPURE GEN3 Model 1000 Heater is a 1483 watt Heating System, is an excellent source of primary heat for up to 400 square feet and a superb source of secondary heat for up to 1000 square feet of well insulated space.  The EdenPURE GEN3 Model 500 Heater 900 watt Heating System, is an excellent source of primary heat for up to 200 square feet and a superb source of secondary heat for up to 300 square feet of well insulated space. Translation:  More nonsense.  Heat loss for any given room in a house depends on a host of variables:  Outside wall area, floor area, ceiling area, window area, door area and local climate conditions to name but a few.  Matching a heating appliance without taking heat loss into account is incompetent. Q. Why does the EdenPURE Heater System cost more than a space heater?A. It is a furnace in every respect. A space heater only has the capacity to heat a small space (i. e. under a desk). The EdenPURE Heater System, like a central heating system, will heat an entire area evenly and efficiently. This allows the unit to be a supplemental source of heat. Furthermore, the EdenPURE Heater System is safe. It will not start a fire or burn if you touch it. Because of the reduced energy consumption, and the unit's high level of safety and comfort, EdenPURE Heater System users agree that it is the best value available. Translation:  The EdenPURE is a space heater in every respect.  It isn't a furnace.  A furnace is designed to heat an entire home.  The EdenPURE is not.  Properly installed and maintained furnaces are safe, too.  Duh.  Too many EdenPURE owners are way too embarrassed by what they paid for it to say anything other than what a great value it is. Q. Why is the EdenPURE Heater System safe?A. The EdenPURE Heater System has no flame or fumes. Its safe, clean infrared heating elements provide the energy. Extensive testing at CUL (Canada) and UL (United States) has verified the safety of the EdenPURE Heater System. Due to its safe operating temperature, the EdenPURE Heater may be placed next to flammable materials with minimal safety clearance needed. Translation:  All appliances sold in the USA, including space heaters and furnaces, are listed with Underwriters Laboratories.  Big Deal. Q. What kind of Satisfaction Guarantee does it have?A. We have a 60 day Satisfaction Guarantee. Our Return Policy: You can return or exchange any purchase within 60 days for any reason. NOTE: Items must be returned in the same box & packaging received by you with everything that was included in the original shipment. Translation:  Wow.  Sixty days.  So, when you discover that it doesn't save you a dime you are totally screwed.  Nice policy. The hundreds of other scam artists that peddle this device go even further with the \"cured copper\" BS by creating their own little urban legend about its \"discovery.\"  Here is the story that they peddle:\"'This advanced heating element was discovered accidentally by a man named John Jones. He had a large old farmhouse that was impossible to heat. Jones had a coal furnace in his basement. Jones placed a sheet of cured copper near the furnace to store it. Cured copper is a type of copper that goes through an extensive heating process to give it special properties. ''After the fire went out in the coal furnace, Jones noticed that the sheet of copper was heating his entire basement evenly, even though the furnace was no longer putting out heat. He also was amazed as to how long the heat stayed in the copper and continued to warm the room. ''Jones was so taken back by this that he started to experiment. He formed a company to develop a heating source out of this cured copper. But Jones had a number of children and he did not want a heating source that would cause a fire or create other hazardous situations like creating carbon monoxide or radiation. He also did not want his children to get burned. To make a long story short, through a great deal of research and development, Jones developed a heating source that utilized commercial infrared quartz tubes.  John Jones designed his heating source around the three most important consumer benefits: economy, comfort, and safety. The final development of this infrared quartz heat source cannot be matched by any other heating system in the world.\"Translation:  Pure and utter BS from start to finish.  There is no such thing as \"cured copper.\"  It has no \"special properties\" other than to separate you from several hundred bucks.  Take a little stroll over to copper. o r g and try your hardest to find a reference to it.  It does not exist except in the minds of simpletons. The final nail in this smelly little coffin comes from Consumer Reports:\"The unit was the secondlowestscoring space heater we tested, earning only a 24 on our 100point scale. According to the folks in our Tech department who tested space heaters, the EdenPure provided lackluster temperature control and was not particularly easy to use, What's more, it was pricey and lacked an overheatprotection feature (key for safety).

      "Paul Harvey was a great man.  He was a pioneer in radio broadcasting especially in regard to the talk radio genre.  He was a decent person.  One of the \"good guys.\"  In 2005, President George W. Bush awarded Mr. Harvey the Presidential Medal of Freedom.  And  recently he passed away. But even great men have flaws.  Paul Harvey had been quoted as saying, \"I am fiercely loyal to those willing to put their money where my mouth is.\"  And therein, lies a conflict of interest. Now, I have no way of knowing whether or not Mr. Harvey knowingly endorsed fraudulent products but it is utterly indisputable that he did endorse the main product of Suarez Corporation Industries. You undoubtedly have never heard of SCI but if you were a regular or even semiregular listener of Paul Harvey you would have heard him endorse the miraculous EdenPURE heater with its revolutionary \"cured copper\" heat exchanger. SCI is a prime supplier to the multilevel marketing community.  Some of the companies that make up SCI are: Biotech Research International Home Shopping Lindenwold Fine Jewelers U. S. Commemorative Gallery Biotech Medical, LLC Resource PartnersThis list is a smorgasbord of overpriced, yet intensely crappy products.  (Oh sure, they sell the TempurPedic line of closed cell foam mattresses which are merely overpriced...you can pick up the exact same thing at Walmart for a fraction of their cost.)  This company is a virtual feeding frenzy for multilevel marketing scammers. But I am only going to focus on their most prominent scam product:  The EdenPURE heater. The EdenPURE heater is the most expensive 115volt electric space heater money can buy, bar none, and it is marketed with, at best, halftruths and, at worst, blatant lies. Compounding the problem is literally hundreds (if not thousands) of independent distributors, many of them not authorized resellers. So lets get into the meat of the issue.  Just what does SCI, through its Biotech Research subsidiary, claim that the EdenPURE can do?  Here are some select pickings from their FAQ page:Q. What is the EdenPURE Heater Quartz Infrared Heating System?A. Our Heating System is a revolutionary zone furnace that safely and efficiently heats entire areas that need additional heat. Translation:  It's a portable electric space heater. Q. How do the EdenPURE Quartz Infrared Portable Heaters Work?A. With the advent of microelectronic technology and the latest in infrared commercial quartz tubes, three solar copper furnaces inside the unit absorb the heat from these tubes much like a sponge absorbs water. The patent pending process of cured natural copper creates an innovative heat exchanger capable of absorbing heat like a solar sponge. It then safely exhales what is coined as \"soft\" environmentally friendly heat that is able to travel rapidly in relative humidity. The EdenPURE SOFT heat does not burn up the humidity; moreover, it employs the humidity as a vehicle to warm up large spaces quickly and efficiently. EdenPURE heater has perfectly regulated heat that will not destroy life/energy that other dangerous portable heating devices destroy, but helps to maintain healthy humidity levels indoors. Other heaters cause occupants to lose energy and force them to breathe dry uncomfortable air. The EdenPURE heater replicates the earth's sun process by electronically exhaling comfortable cost cutting heat without burning up your family's life sustaining oxygen in your indoor living space. The benefits of this natural solar process are revolutionizing the way we will heat our homes and help save large amounts of costly energy. Translation:  Let the BS begin.  Taking it itembyitem: Microelectronic technology.  Translation:  It has a digital thermostat. The latest in infrared commercial quartz tubes.  Translation:  Three 500watt halogen light bulbs.  Big woop. Three solar copper furnaces.  Translation:  Copper pipe cut to length that surround the light bulbs. Cured natural copper.  Translation:  Fairy dust & unicorn farts.  There is no such thing as \"cured\" copper. It then safely exhales.  Translation:  It has a blower.\"Soft\" environmentally friendly heat.  Translation:  More fairy dust. Does not burn up humidity.  Translation:  Utter nonsense, heaters don't dehumidify. Will not destroy life/energy.  Translation:  Utter nonsense for the mentally challenged. Helps to maintain healthy humidity levels.  Translation:  Utter nonsense, totally impossible. Other heaters cause occupants to lose energy.  Translation:  We think you are stupid. Replicates the earth's sun process.  Translation:  We think you are really, really stupid. Electronically exhales.  Translation:  We are doubling down on the stupid thing. Without burning...oxygen.  Translation:  Just in case you are an absolute idiot we are tossing this one in out of sheer spite. Helps save large amounts of costly energy:  Translation:  Compared to what?  Plutonium?Now back to the FAQ's...Q. What makes the EdenPURE Heater \"Healthier\" than other heaters?A. For one... the EdenPURE heater does not produce positive ions like other blower (dryer) type heaters. EdenPURE heater has perfectly regulated heat that will not destroy life/energy that other dangerous portable heating devices destroy, but helps to maintain healthy humidity levels indoors. Since the early 1950s scientists have suspected that ions play an important role in how the body functions and, consequently, in how we feel. Research has shown that an abundance of negative ions in the air we breathe is highly beneficial. Conversely, scientists have found that if the air is charged with too few negative ions and too many positives, we become anxious, fatigued and tense. Positive ion poisoning has, in fact, been linked to heart attacks, aggravated asthma, migraine headaches, insomnia, rheumatism, arthritis, hay fever, and most allergies. Translation:  Wow.  This is industrial strength BS at its finest.  To me, this is holistic, pseudoscience mumbo jumbo that is ridiculous and claiming that other heaters produce positive ions is utter rubbish thrown out there for the slowwitted. Q. How does the comfort of the EdenPURE Heater System compare to other systems?A. The EdenPURE Heater System is a state of the art system that provides the most comfortable form of heat. Unlike traditional systems, which may leave a differential of up to 18 degrees from floor to ceiling, the EdenPURE Heater System heated air, using infrared absorption, does not concentrate near the ceiling. Heat stays down and evenly dispersed in the area where you and your family live. Temperature difference from floor to ceiling is minimal. In addition, the EdenPURE Heater System does not remove humidity from the air. It actually helps maintain humidity levels. The even heating and higher humidity permit lower heat settings with more comfort, less condensation on windows and less static electricity. Furthermore, the EdenPURE Heater System does not use flame, fuel or any form of combustion. Therefore, the heat from the EdenPURE Heater is safe and clean  free of any other type of pollution and does not use up the oxygen in the air. Translation:  Okay, well this is more crap served up with a very large spoon...maybe even with a funnel and a hose. The EdenPURE is, despite claims to the contrary, a forced air electric space heater.  There is nothing magical about what it does.  Room temperature air comes in one end and higher temperature air comes out the other end.  That's it. Warm air rises due to a property in air called \"convection.\"  To minimize the natural process of convection the air in a room may be  circulated.  Ceiling fans do this quite nicely. There is no heater made that removes humidity from air.  It is a physical impossibility.  Period.  To remove humidity from air one must lower the air temperature below its dew point.  This is called condensation.  Think of the \"sweat\" that occurs on a glass of ice water.  If  water condenses on the inside of your windows it is because there is a source of excess humidity in the house...someone left the shower running...and the glass is below the dew point.  The EdenPURE heater is totally incapable of maintaining ANY level of humidity.  Winter air is dry.  Go to NOAA and look it up. Any properly installed heating system will not use up the oxygen of the occupied space.  Again, nothing magical here. Q. Economically, how does the EdenPURE Heater System compare to other systems?A. The EdenPURE Heater System is the most economical way to heat. In Midwestern Utility field tests for heating seasons, the EdenPURE Heater used an average of 35% less energy than conventional electric furnace/baseboard systems. Comparable results were found during comparisons with fuel based heating systems. Individual results, of course, depend on insulation values, local climate, and other conditions. Translation:  This is a pure lie.  The most economical way to heat using electricity is with a heat pump.  So, yeah, individual results depend on \"other conditions.\"  These (along with that old favorite, \"individual results may vary\") are what are called \"weasel words.\"Q. How much area does a EdenPURE Heater System Heat?A. The EdenPURE GEN3 Model 1000 Heater is a 1483 watt Heating System, is an excellent source of primary heat for up to 400 square feet and a superb source of secondary heat for up to 1000 square feet of well insulated space.  The EdenPURE GEN3 Model 500 Heater 900 watt Heating System, is an excellent source of primary heat for up to 200 square feet and a superb source of secondary heat for up to 300 square feet of well insulated space. Translation:  More nonsense.  Heat loss for any given room in a house depends on a host of variables:  Outside wall area, floor area, ceiling area, window area, door area and local climate conditions to name but a few.  Matching a heating appliance without taking heat loss into account is incompetent. Q. Why does the EdenPURE Heater System cost more than a space heater?It is a furnace in every respect. A space heater only has the capacity to heat a small space (i. e. under a desk). The EdenPURE Heater System, like a central heating system, will heat an entire area evenly and efficiently. This allows the unit to be a supplemental source of heat. Furthermore, the EdenPURE Heater System is safe. It will not start a fire or burn if you touch it. Because of the reduced energy consumption, and the unit's high level of safety and comfort, EdenPURE Heater System users agree that it is the best value available. Translation:  The EdenPURE is a space heater in every respect.  It isn't a furnace.  A furnace is designed to heat an entire home.  The EdenPURE is not.  Properly installed and maintained furnaces are safe, too.  Duh.  Too many EdenPURE owners are way too embarrassed by what they paid for it to say anything other than what a great value it is. Q. Why is the EdenPURE Heater System safe?A. The EdenPURE Heater System has no flame or fumes. Its safe, clean infrared heating elements provide the energy. Extensive testing at CUL (Canada) and UL (United States) has verified the safety of the EdenPURE Heater System. Due to its safe operating temperature, the EdenPURE Heater may be placed next to flammable materials with minimal safety clearance needed. Translation:  All appliances sold in the USA, including space heaters and furnaces, are listed with Underwriters Laboratories.  Big Deal. Q. What kind of Satisfaction Guarantee does it have?A. We have a 60 day Satisfaction Guarantee. Our Return Policy: You can return or exchange any purchase within 60 days for any reason. NOTE: Items must be returned in the same box & packaging received by you with everything that was included in the original shipment. Translation:  Wow.  Sixty days.  So, when you discover that it doesn't save you a dime you are totally screwed.  Nice policy. The hundreds of other scam artists that peddle this device go even further with the \"cured copper\" BS by creating their own little urban legend about its \"discovery.\"  Here is the story that they peddle:\"'This advanced heating element was discovered accidentally by a man named John Jones. He had a large old farmhouse that was impossible to heat. Jones had a coal furnace in his basement. Jones placed a sheet of cured copper near the furnace to store it. Cured copper is a type of copper that goes through an extensive heating process to give it special properties. ''After the fire went out in the coal furnace, Jones noticed that the sheet of copper was heating his entire basement evenly, even though the furnace was no longer putting out heat. He also was amazed as to how long the heat stayed in the copper and continued to warm the room. ''Jones was so taken back by this that he started to experiment. He formed a company to develop a heating source out of this cured copper. But Jones had a number of children and he did not want a heating source that would cause a fire or create other hazardous situations like creating carbon monoxide or radiation. He also did not want his children to get burned. To make a long story short, through a great deal of research and development, Jones developed a heating source that utilized commercial infrared quartz tubes.  John Jones designed his heating source around the three most important consumer benefits: economy, comfort, and safety. The final development of this infrared quartz heat source cannot be matched by any other heating system in the world.\"Translation:  Pure and utter BS from start to finish.  There is no such thing as \"cured copper.\"  It has no \"special properties\" other than to separate you from several hundred bucks.  Take a little stroll over to copper. o r g and try your hardest to find a reference to it.  It does not exist except in the minds of simpletons. The final nail in this smelly little coffin comes from Consumer Reports:\"The unit was the secondlowestscoring space heater we tested, earning only a 24 on our 100point scale.

      "There are a few variations on these presses, some make 12 slightly smaller ravioli, some make 10 slightly larger ravioli. \"Ravioli\" is plural, there is no word \"raviolis\", but we're English speakers, so I guess we can say raviolis anyway. Be aware that if you can't afford this right now, there are videos at YouTube that show how to make rav with NO equipment at all. There's a chubby guy who thinks these presses are the best. I got mine at a thrift shop, its ancient, slightly different design from anything they sell today, though it functions identically, but the \"presser\"(dimpler?) part is also aluminum, there's no plastic. If you can't afford one of these presses(plates) now, you can still make rav. If you don't have a pasta machine, all you need is a rolling pin. If you don't have a rolling pin, go find an empty wine bottle, it can serve as a rolling pin. Learn how to make pasta and ravioli. Then invite me over a lot. Do you think I'm writing this review for fun? I envision a world in which everyone else will make my food for me. I'll never need to cook again. This is my first attempt towards that goal, though right now I'm also working on world domination, too. I hope this cooking thing goes better than the domination thing. Type \"Easy Ravioli Making with a Ravioli Plate\" over at YouTube. This guy'll show you how to make rav with a special pin, a press(plate, i. e., this item I'm reviewing), and even an attachment to the pasta machine. There's a separate video for each method. He has several videos covering pasta making. There may be other good videos on this topic, but this guy does well in teaching, IMO. His name is \"tarotbear\", you can search on his username. He has several pasta videos, but also some totally unrelated videos on things you may not have interest in. (I didn't.)With this press you can make pierogis, or any other ethnic variation of ravioli. Pierogis are typically half moons, but who cares if they look like rav? Pierogi are sometimes filled with fruit, sauerkraut, potatos, lotsa different things. I only know a bit about pierogi, but making ravioli opens up SO many new possibilities. I think pierogi are often fried after being boiled, not that strange, as I like to sautee rav in butter after they've been boiled. Would it be possible to make little Indian Samosas with this press?  I don't know, if interested, look into it. There's a Japanese(?) thing called \"gyoza\"(?) that is an Asian version (I think) of rav. Then there are pot stickers. All races, at all times throughout history, have had their share of smart people. They all came up with similar stuff. Ravioli exists in most cultures(although by other names), though they may be a bit different in size, shape, or filling. Just use your rav press, make them all, who cares about ethnic authenticity?There are tons of vegetarian choices in both rav and pierogies. I don't know if vegan choices exist. Cheese is used in most things, or so it seems, but I'm no expert on that. Supposedly, you're better off with unbleached flour. Bob's Red Mill sells semolina flour, which is another type of flour, but not necessary. Some don't wanna use semolina, anyway.  Semolina is a bit more expensive, may not be available to all, and may not even be an improvement. A lot of sites suggest \"unbleached flour\".I think you should strive to use at least unbleached white flour, regular bleached white flour possibly may work as well, I'm not sure. You can even use no more than 50% whole wheat flour, that's another thing that's optional. Keep it simple, start with regular white flour. Save these other flours for a later date, when you're more experienced. Buy \"unbleached\" white flour if you can find it. I think there's even a way to incorporate cornmeal in the dough for pasta, I don;t yet know exactly how to do it. I'm still learning, and still paying dues. Start with regular white flour, unbleached, if you can find unbleached. KISS=keep it simple, stupid!BUT, use whatever your recipe calls for, as far as type of flour. There are recipes all over the web. Google \"pasta recipes\" or \"making pasta\", you'll find lotsa useful stuff. Don't get hung up on any particular type of flour you can't find, you can probably succeed with most recipes, and most flours, especially white flours. BTW: I've read the reviews on this pasta press(plate) and a few others. Its amazing what you can learn. Several people have turned their pasta presses black by putting them in an automatic dishwasher, and they are unhappy. I don't have a dishwasher, so it ain't gonna happen to me. You've been warned. Actually, I just wipe my press off with a paper towel, very well. Any tiny amount of oil or flour is not gonna go bad. Cooking oil lasts a long time, as does flour.  Wipe it very well with the paper towel, that should do the job. Any tiny amounts of oil and/or flour aren't gonna go bad and poison you. You don't put a well seasoned black cast iron frying pan into soapy water, most of us use various techniques to clean such frying pans that often involve no water. Its possible to keep your pasta press quite clean by wiping it with a paper towel. Water is probably unnecessary for cleaning. Wanna cheat? Buy won ton wrappers, make rav outa that. Put some filling in the middle of a wonton wrapper, then fold the wrapper over on itself. Not authentic, but easy!You'll be eating your whole life, so I think ravmaking is a valuable skill. Cheat with won ton wrappers, but still find a method that works for you to make REAL rav. Before applying top layer of pasta, you can quickly run a wet finger along all the surfaces where top and bottom layer will meet. Dip your finger in a cup of water, no need to use egg. You can use egg if you want, though. Put the egg in a cup, blend it up with a fork. Its just that water is so much easier to use. One reviewer said they have a problem w/ sticking if they only put flour on the press before applying first pasta layer. It worked for me, though. You can spray w/Pam, or just dip your pinky into corn oil or olive oil, \"painting\" frame w/ oil. I find both oil or flour works. Use what's handiest. You don't want pasta too thick, or it'll be really thick at edges, where the 2 layers overlap, but too thin and it'll break. They say you should be able to vaguely make out the silhouette of your hand when looking through the pasta sheet you use to make rav. For those without a pasta machine:Someone mentioned they made a rolling pin of PVC tubing, how clever. Read that review. You can make pasta or ravioli WITHOUT a press or plate or a pasta machine, as long as you have something to function as a rolling pin, whether that be a real rolling pin, or a wine bottle. The rolling pin is used even with this pasta press(or plate) to seal the individual ravs shut. There's a sort of zigzag between each pasta square, by rolling across the plate, you create \"serrations\" that make it easy(easier) to tear apart the ravioli squares. If you had this plate/press and rolled out your dough with a pasta machine, you could get by without a rolling pin. You'd need to use the back of a spoon, run it along the zigzag serrations between each rav square. It'd work fine.(Or use a wine bottle) Using a rolling pin doesn't always lead to neat cuts, You can run along the \"serrated\" parts of mold with back of spoon or whatever you think of, along those areas that didn't cut as cleanly after using the rolling pin. Each ravioli \"hole\" in the press(plate) is surrounded by a zigzag, raised line. (That's what I'm calling serrated.)If these serrated edges (zigzags) were sharp, they'd just get dull right away, and it'd be dangerous to wash. You may need to take a little extra care to assure a clean cut around each rav. Some say to let ravs rest 20 mins after assembling, wait till they turn leathery. On Ciao Italia(a PBS Italian cooking show),the lady boils them immediately after assembling them. I imagine either way works. You can freeze the rav first, maybe, just maybe, that'll prevent \"bleeding\" if a rav wasnt sealed well. One reviewer suggested a method, they poke a hole w/ a toothpick, and \"burp\" each rav. I'll need to try it. Flour each rav generously, else they stick together and you'll have a mess. I ran across a suggestion that after one makes their rav, they place it not on a cookie sheet but on a cooling rack, maybe like what I've seen people put cakes on, kind of a crisscross grid affairwhere air can circulate around most of the cake. Rav that sticks has been a real problem for me, even though I flour each rav with flour or cornmeal before placing it on a cookie sheet. I didn't flour sufficiently, one time, then put them all on a cookie sheet and into the freezer. Some like to freeze them before boiling. Problem wasbecause I didn't put enough flour on each rav before freezing, they all stuck together, even after I tried thawing them out in desperation.( I wanted to stick them in the boiling water when they were still frozen.)I think the thick spinach/ricotta filling saved me, the filling didn't totally bleed into the boil water. I guess the filling was too thick to bleed outa the rav. There was some leakage, it could/should have been much worse. I got lucky, but you don't wanna depend on luck. You can either flour the ravs after they come off the press(plate), or use cornmeal. Pretty much all of what you put on to prevent sticking is gonna get washed away in the boil water, anyway. So, use what you need to prevent sticking. The excess flour'll come off in the water. For boiling, use plenty of water, a big pot, and add enough salt till water tastes like seawater. And wait till water comes to boil, be patient! Don't put the rav in water till the water boils!Put some salt in water after its come to a boil, some would say add salt till it tastes like seawater, but are you gonna taste test boiling water? I don't think so. Do your best. Someone suggested a melon baller as a \"portion control device\" to get the right amount of filling in each rav. I just use a measuring spoon, and I'm still trying to get it all right. Don't overfill, figure out for yourself what size measuring spoon to use. Overfilling can lead to breakage while boiling. Too much trapped air in rav can also cause the rav to \"pop\" open in the boiling water. You could try poking each rav with a toothpick, then with a wet finger, seal that little puncture, after burping(pressing any air out of) the rav. Squash and pumpkin(similar) or calabaza( a squash, don't ask me, I'm not Spanish) make good veggie fillings. Canned pumpkin makes things easyrememberall fillings must be thoroughly cooked before they are put into ravioli. It must be that wayyou couldn't be sure the filling was cooked just from the boiling water you throw the ravs into. Uncooked meat or egg in a filling could be a health hazard if not cooked before putting them into pasta!Cheese never needs to be cooked, but even vegetables should be cooked BEFORE putting them in a ravioli. And if you live in a Spanish neighborhood, instead of  ricotta, you can use reques&oacute;n. Cottage cheese will work. Don't think you need to be \"authentic Italian\". The first batch I ever made was loaded with Chihuahua cheese and spinach, I used Mexican oregano. I topped them with grated cotija. I don't know if there was such a thing as Mexican ravioli, but there is now. You can all thank me when you get around to it. Amazon has a few books on vegetarian pasta:1)\"The Best 125 Meatless Pasta Dishes\"2)\"Pasta Verde\"3?)\"Quick from Scratch Pasta Cookbook\" has some veggie choices, the first 2 books I listed are a better bet for vegetarians. If any of these books are outa print, maybe you can get them from Amazon's \"used\" sellers, or find the books at eBay. Or search the web for recipes, vegetarian or otherwise. Spinach is used fairly commonly in vegetarian fillings. Cook it very briefly(find instructions on web), then wring it out with your hands, a really wet filling will mess up your rav. A really good wringing by hand will work, that's how I've always done it. Now that I have a potato ricer, I may use that to squeeze the water outa spinach. The potato ricer is hardly necessary, but since I now have it...You can also have fun, later on, coloring your rav. Beet juice really imparts no flavor(I hate beets), but does give a pinkish/red color to rav. I found that the color was largely bleached out in the boil water. But I'll try some more tricks. This might not be the first thing you should experiment with. Various vegetables and spices can add color, or specks of color to your rav. But that's for later, keep it simple at first. Some pastas are colored with food dyes, if that's your thing, fine. I wanna do it naturally. But making good pasta comes before making pretty colored pasta. (Pasta colorata!) Wow! I know 2 words of Italian!!There are even tricks for getting stripes along each rav, though I suspect the pretty colors are so vivid, that they were made from food dye. I need to perfect my pasta making skills before I try all the cutesie stuff. The press does have a slight tendency to slip as you run rolling pin over it. I'm just careful. Maybe it'd help if you put press on a towel? If that doesn't work, try a damp towel? I just deal with it. copied from elsewhere, this is what I was saying, they say it better:Sauerkraut PierogisMakes 30 pierogis(Poland)Every country has its own version of a dumpling,  basically cooked balls of dough made of flour, potatoes, bread or matzoh containing meats, seafood, vegetables or sweets.  The Italians lay claim to  ravioli , the Chinese to potstickers, Indians to Somosas, and the Polish to Pierogis.  There are probably as many different recipes for Pierogis as there are Polish families, this recipe is my (Italian) interpretation.  A genuine Polish friend of mine says  the only way to eat Pierogis is lightly fried in bacon grease  and topped with bacon crumbles, and  golden, caramelized onions \"Co jest nie tak!\" (What's not to like!  . . .  Enjoy!And all these foods can be made with a ravioli press!All my life, spaghetti and other pastas have been served to me on flat dinner plates. I never knew any better. There's nothing like a \"pasta bowl\" to eat from. Its just deep enough to prevent pasta from being pushed over the edge. They're nice. They're usually around 8 inches in diameter. Look for them on Amazon or eBay. Get good stuff, that can go from frij to microwave oven to dishwasher, and often they can be used on stove or oven, though I'm not sure why you'd want to use the dish in the oven or on a stove top.\"Henn\", I think, is a good American manufacturer of pasta dishes, though I believe they're now outa production. If you don't wanna put out the $$, find out what they look like, then go to Thrift/Second hand stores. I've bought several from about $2 to $6. Of course, I had to accept the style/color/pattern that was available. Don't buy some Chinese junk that's plastic, and isn't even safe in the microwave. If buying in person, look at the bottom of dish for words stating its microwave safe, dishwasher safe, and probably stove or oven safe. Older stuff is better, stuff made before the Chinese took over the making of everything. Their safety record stinks, I don't want Chinese anything if I can avoid it. At times, I realize, I have repeated myself, but its hard to edit while you can only see a tiny window at a time, you just see what fits in a little box. I'm not gonna go over it again for errors, it'll have to do. This isn't intended to win me a literary prize of any kind. Maybe it will inspire some to try their hand at ravioli and pasta making. Since I'm still kinda new to this, as I write it, I still think like a beginner, and have tried to share what I've learned, hoping to speed others up. I've tried to steer other beginners in good directions. If you don't like my review, don't be discouraged, maybe you'll learn better from someone else. UPDATE: I think I mentioned some trouble after freezing some ravioli. They all stuck together. I just read some advice saying you should let the ravs dry on the counter for at least an hour, at least long enough that they're no longer sticky, and can be safely put in a ziplock bag. I haven't tried this yet, but I'll bet it makes good sense. Once you've got a sheet of pasta dough, use it IMMEDIATELY. You don't want it to dry out. You need to put filling on that first layer, then the top layer of pasta dough. These 2 layers of pasta dough need to be fresh so they'll adhere to one another. Once you've made your pasta \"pillows\", ie, your ravioli, NOW you want it to dry a bit before you stick it in the freezer. So let it sit for that hour. Also, if you can avoid letting the ravioli dry on a flat surface, that would be best. If you have a cooling rack or some kinda screen or something, that would be best.\n",

      "If you're an avid reader of reviews at amazon and other websites and cringe when a review of a product is given a One Star rating because of it being 1) Damaged when it arrives; 2) Lost in shipment; 3) Wasn't an iPad (even if it was a water bottle!) or 4) Poor customer service, you're not alone. So, I've structured this review to try and appease most readers. My review begins with \"Background\", as to WHY I bought this particular 2 pie unit vs. the 4 pie unit and why I bought it from amazon. Skip ahead to Part I if you don't want to know the background.  Part I is the quick and short of it; you want the facts and then you want to move on. Part II is the part that would normally drag a product review down, when it has absolutely NOTHING to do with the physical product but with the Instruction Booklet/Customer Service.  Part III is for the reader that wants/enjoys a more indepth review. This is where I get \"chatty\", again.  Part IV is the wrapup.\"BACKGROUND\": I've been baking pies for over a half a century. My Granma was a professional pie baker at the turn of the century in a hotel along the shores of Lake Superior. She'd bake 30 pies per day for the week and 50 pies per day for the weekend. Those were the days when you cut a pie into quarters and men ate the slice with their bare hands. Iron ore miners and loggers stopped by for Take Out lunches at the back door; the more genteel folks ate in the dining room. By time she married at 27 years old, (which was ancient in 1901), she had already baked thousands of pies...and I was lucky enough to be taught at her knee when she and my Granpa raised me on their dairy farm. Fast forward to 2012. You know that expression, \"Easy As Pie\"? Well, it's that easy for me. I can cobble together a pie from scratch as easily as making toast. I have every gewgaw and doodad and pan and crimper possible, to make pies and tarts. So....WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD I BUY THIS SUPPOSEDLY SILLY PIE MAKING MACHINE? Good question! LOL Serendipity, I suppose. I saw the 4 pie maker featured in an email from a famous cooking website. I never knew such a machine existed. I went to the site, read the reviews, they were ALL awful and they recommended the 2 unit pie maker rather than the 4 unit pie maker. (Size of pies was the size of Oreo cookies, most said.) Since the original website did NOT carry the 2 unit pie maker, I headed over to amazon...my idea of website Heaven. Typed in the manufacturer and pie size and came here. Read the few reviews. I had a small balance on a Christmas Gift Card. I ordered it. End of story. Well, sort of. When I told my 23 year old daughter about the pie maker coming, she stared at me and said, \"What ever possessed you do order a gimmicky thing like that?\" I shrugged and said, \"Well, it will either work or be donated to Goodwill.\"Only a matter of days later, the pie maker arrived. Packaged securely, box in good condition, not only an \"Instruction Book\" but an instruction book with RECIPES! Score! Read through the book twice, highlighted the important stuff, noticed some SERIOUS OMISSIONS, had 2 family members look at the booklet again, they concurred that there were some serious omissions, and then walked away from the unit, sure that I'd never use it now that it had arrived and that it's purchase had been a temporary folly on my part. Now, I'm going to skip the rest of the story until Part III. Part one is for the person who just wants \"The Bottom Line.\" Part II are the Negative Comments that have nothing to do with the pie maker.\"PART I\"Shipped in nice box. Came with dough cutting rings, which other website did NOT offer. Heated up well and fast. NOTHING STUCK TO THE INTERIOR, even when the filling overflowed. Baked a crispy, beautifully light brown crust in exactly 8 minutes, as advertised.  Clean up was a dream. Will be in use several times a week if not daily. There!NOTE: The booklet warns of a \"chemical or burnt smell\" when you first plug it in. To get rid of this, after washing the device, I turned it on and off a total of eight different times the first day I got it. After the eighth time, there was no longer the burning plastic smell. I wanted to make sure that it was 100% gone, so it didn't transfer to the food. Time it was left on was 10 minutes, each time.\"PART II\"The NotSoGood Points of the review! Okay, when I opened up the pie machine, I must admit, I was taken aback with how small the pie wells were.  If the original complaints about the 4pie machine were about the \"small size\", then I'd hate to see how miniscule those pie wells were, by comparison! I flipped through the Instruction/Recipe booklet to see what amount of filling the manufacturer recommended to \"not exceed\". I couldn't find it. So, I took my time, read every frickin' page, including the pages telling you to \"not place in water while plugged into the socket\" and I STILL COULD NOT FIND ANY REFERENCE TO MAXIMUM LIMIT WITH FILLING. So, I turned to the recipes; surely, in each recipe, it would state, \"Once the filling is cooked, spoon  into the pie crust.\" Nope! Nothing. Nadda. Zip! I turned the booklet over to both my husband and daughter and even their Eagle Eye's couldn't find anything. Now, in reading the recipes, they were listing quantities of FOUR, count'em, FOUR cups of fruit...or ONE POUND OF CHICKEN...and that was just the start of the recipe! Factor in the sugar, or flour or vegetables to each recipe and you were ending up with a minimum of a quart to a quart and a half of finished filling. Once again, where the recipe should have stated: \"Yields  pies\", it stated nothing! So, I took matters into my own hands. First, I took a measuring tablespoon and a one quarter measuring cup and carefully filled each well, to see what I could come up with. In one well, I got 3.5 tablespoons of water until it reached the top of the bottom plate. With the 1/4 cup measuring cup, I got most of the water into the well, but it overflowed when the full 1/4 cup was emptied into it. I now knew that with the bulk of the pastry in the bottom, I could only have 3 tablespoons of filling, per pie. WHY WASN'T THIS STATED ANYWHERE IN THE BOOKLET?????? And with recipes yielding over 1.5 quarts of filling, just how many zillions of pies was I supposed to make?So, I called the manufacturer's phone number located on the back page where it was listed as \"Customer Support.\" Hardly. insert eye roll> HERE&lt;\" Called the number. It rang 10 times. Finally, it was auto answered and I was told \"All of our customer support people are currently helping others. Your business is important to us. Please stay on the line....blahblahblah.\" (we all know that dialog!) Two minutes later, a woman came on the line. The conversation went as follows:Her: \"How can I help you?\"Me: \"Hi. I bought your 2 pie maker unit. In your recipe section of the book, there's no mention of the recommended filling portion for the individual pies and no mention at the bottom of the recipes of how many pies each recipe makes. Do you have those figures?\"Her: silenceMe: \"Hello?\"Her: \"Yes. I heard you. Well, just fill up each pie crust with filling until it reaches the top. Then don't fill it any more.\"Me: \"Yes. I understand that concept. But every other baking product I own from waffle makers to aebelskiver pans lists the volume of batter or crust or filling to use. And your recipes don't tell you how many pies they yield so I have no idea how much to cut the recipe if I only want to make 2 pies.\"Her: silenceMe: \"Hello?Her: \"Yes. I heard you. Well, the recipes make as many pies as they do. What don't you understand?\"Me: \" I think YOU don't understand. Every recipe ever written professionally has a \"yield\" to it. For instance, 3 dozen cookies or an 8\" double layer cake or 12 biscuits. If these pie filling recipes are for this machine, there should be a \"yields\" quantity at the bottom of each. I can't be the only person who's asked you about this, am I?\"Her: silence and then a sigh \"No. Others have called, too.\"Me: \"Well, if others have called, clearly there's a need for this information. If your company doesn't want to go through the expense of reprinting the entire booklet, they can simple print out a single sheet that is included with each pie maker, explaining that only 33.5 tablespoons of filling can go into each pie crust and the yields of each recipe. You don't even have to reprint the recipes, just print the name of the recipe and the yields.\"Her: sigh \"Thank you. I'll pass that along. Have a nice day.\" clickOkay. So, I knew from that point on, I was on my own with this company. Now, I was beginning to wonder if the actual unit was designed as poorly as customer nonservice! Yes, I'm an experienced baker and cook and yes!, I own a calculator and can break down a recipe but I shouldn't have to. If I read that a pumpkin bread recipe yields 4 giant loaves, I know to whack that recipe by 1/4 to just make a pan of muffins. How hard would it have been to write out, \"Yields 18 pies?\" I guess it was pretty darn hard, because NONE of the recipes showed it. Regarding the actual recipes: they read as tasty. And, I plan to make many of them, but as fullblown pies. With only 3 tablespoons of filling, I want/need this little pie machine to be a breeze, not a chore! No way in heck am I cooking a raw chicken from scratch, making a white sauce and reducing it, to stick 3 tablespoons into a pieette! So, the blueberry pie recipe and the chicken pot pie recipe will just have to be glorified in a standard 9 or 10\" pie shell, thank you very much. Also, the pie crust recipes, of which there were two, did NOT tell you how many wee pie crusts they yielded. This is EXCEEDINGLY POOR PLANNING ON THE PART OF THE MANUFACTURER!!!! But, as the customer nonservice lady may have suggested, \"You'll get as many pie crusts out of the recipe as you get.\"Of all the recipes, there was only one I looked squintyeyed at. It's for a \"Custard Pie Filling.\" It involves eggs and butter and sugar and cornmeal. I somehow suspect that I'd end up with sweet poached eggs, not something tasty in my book. I think I'll take a pass on that one. So, if you've read this far, you now know that if you buy this pie maker, you're on your own for ratios, except for my knowledge that each pie well holds from 3 to 3.5 tablespoons of filling once the crust is in place. But, don't let that dissuade you from buying this machine!!!!! If you're still with me, come along on my daughter's and my journey of discovery and fun with how we turned the day around, making 30 of these darling little pies in one snowy afternoon!!!\"PART III\"I can thank my lucky stars with having a full pantry, a preplanned band practice of my son's in the garage and a Lake Effect Snow Bomb of 20.5 inches in less than 12 hours for putting this pie maker through some SERIOUS paces in less than 24 hours after receiving it! Yes, on the day that I'm writing this, the  south eastern shore of Lake Michigan got a Snow Plume and we became buried under snow, making it the perfect day to experiment. Count a garage full of 8 teenage boys and my daughter staying the weekend and it was the Perfect Storm for pie making!Before we even took out the ingredients to make my Gran's 100+ year old pie crust recipe, we took out a standard premade pie crust package from the frig. I have these on hand 24/7 for Emergency Pie Baking. (yes, such emergencies DO occur!) I've learned with these crusts that they are very thick, in fact, too thick, and yield a doughy bottom crust, by our tastes. So, I place a room temperature pie crust between two lightly floured squares of wax paper and roll it out much thinner. With just ONE crust and one rerolling of scraps, we got THREE top and bottom crusts for the pies, so we immediately rolled out the other one so we could make two pies at once. My daughter was the one to suggest making a \"...different pie in each well\" and using the garage band as our Guinea Pigs, to which the \"boys\" amply agreed. I had some leftover Sherried Chicken Sauce in the frig from dinner the night before, so all we did was reheat exactly one half a cup in a sauce pan to use as our 1st trial. The booklet amply warns in multiple spots, \"This unit gets HOT!!!\" I must give them credit for the liability warnings. However, at no point was the latch that holds it hot or even warm, so we did NOT have to use \"potholders\", as advised, to open or close the machine. I also own a wooden tart tamper, so it made pressing the bottom pie crusts into the well a breeze. Sorry, it came with tart pans I own so I don't know where you can buy one by itself. Putting the pie together was a breeze; we were both very impressed with the ease.  Filling hot. Crusts cut. Unit heated. Open unit. Put in bottom crust. Push down. Fill 3 tablespoons. Put on top crust. Lock unit. Set stove timer for 8 minutes. Tap foot and wait patiently. The indicator light works like a charm and cycled Off and On while it was baking. Steam came out all over the machine, which is normal and around the five minute mark, we could smell the crust and filling. OMG....we could hardly wait!!!!! The timer went off, we used two of my wooden utensils to remove the pies, and placed them on two wee plates. (these first two were for the cooks...it was our Reward or Punishment, depending upon how they turned out.)Observation: Pies came out in a snap! Used a wooden thin spatula and wooden butter spreader. Even the one pie where the filling overflowed, the entire baked filling that oozed out came with the pie. (In defense, we had to see HOW MUCH FILLING went into a pie and the one that used 3.5 tablespoons is the one that oozed over.) The crusts were flawless, absolutely flawless: golden on both top and bottom, flaky and crisp. Now, the proof was in the pudding, er....PIE, I mean. My daughter and I broke open the pie with a fork, steam came pouring out, which was a good sign because that meant it was going to be piping hot, not lukewarm. We were impatient so we ended up mashing up our pies so we could eat them sooner. WHAT AN INCREDIBLE TREAT!!!!! I use a generic premade pie crust because the brand name one is too salty, by our taste. These little sherried chicken pot pies were perfection on a plate! With a proper salad and a small bowl of soup, our family would only need one per person. And what a way to turn a meal around! Normally, I serve the chicken over biscuits, so having the crust vs. biscuits is the same thing: it's a carbohydrate. By our figuring, if you are serving bread, biscuits or crackers with any of these savory sauces, placing the sauce in a pie crust is pretty much equal in calories, maybe less. It was after we both greedily gobbled up our pies that everything turned around. I was still stuck in the traditional pie thinking mode. My daughter, however, said, \"Gee, these pies remind me of empanadas, pasties or samosas!\", and that's all it took to take the adventure into another whole level. As a cook, if you've had ANY of those treats, you know you can stick just about ANYTHING in a samosa or empanada and call it \"good\". And that's what we ended up doing! We cleaned out the frig! We opened up cans! Our goal was to make the pies as 1) simple and 2) easy and 3) goofproof (read: brotherproof) as possible so this machine wouldn't die a slow death in the back of the pantry and then be given away, 10 years from now. While daughter was clearing out the frig, I made my standard pie crust and cut out 28 tops and bottoms, storing them on a turkey platter with waxed paper protecting each layer. Now that that was done, all we had to do was brush liquid Crisco Oil on the top and bottom of the cool unit and away we went. This is everything we shoved into the crusts; we made NOTHING new! It was all scraps from the frig or stuff straight from a can or jar. Our goal was to make this \"Instant, Good Snack Food\". We succeeded!!! A) Bits of pot roast, gravy, peas, carrots and potatoes. B) Scrambled eggs with chorizo and salsa. C) Salmon, asparagus and smashed potatoes with sour cream. D) Peanut Butter and Strawberry Jelly. &lt;&lt;&lt;a HUGE hit with the guys! E) Shrimp Lo Mein. F) Chili with cornbread cubes. G) Applesauce. Yes, you read that right. Just plain natural applesauce right from one of those 1/2 cup carry along lunch bag things. We glazed the baked pie with a powdered sugar icing; it was to die for! H) Shredded corned beef, 1000 Island Sauce, and Shredded smoked Gorgonzola cheese. &lt;&lt;the boys fought THIS one! I) Just smashed potatoes and cooked veggies.&lt;Daughter loved this one! Dad is Scottish so this reminded her of Scottish pasties. J) Chopped up canned peaches mixed with honey yogurt and granola.&lt;&lt;&lt;I wanted to roll around in this, it was SO good! K) Hubby's Favourite! If you've ever had the British Beans on Toast, I filled one pie with Heinz British Baked Beans and when done, slapped a square of cheese over the top, and Bob's Your Uncle, gave it to hubby. He said it was the \"Best Beans on Toast\" he'd ever had, drunk or sober! LOLAnd the #1 \"What were you thinking when you thought this one up\" version??? Scooping JellO Chocolate Fudge Pudding right from the small container directly into the pie crust (one pudding pack is too much for one pie and too little for two), baking it and serving vanilla frozen yogurt over the top of it!!!! THAT ONE&lt; we made several of, because everyone in the house wanted their own pie!\"PART IV\"So, there you have it. I gave you a Short Version, a Long Version, the Very, Very Good About the Product version and the Achilles' Heel about the Recipe booklet version. As an over view: am I happy I bought this gizmo? You betcha!!!! What started out as a way to burn up the last bucks on a gift card turned into a machine I hope is in almost daily use. I am making the pie crusts from scratch, in bulk, and freezing them for instant use for everyone to enjoy. Rather than a high calorie junk food snack that's filled with empty calories and tons of sodium and artificial colousr and flavours, my family and I can enjoy a small, healthy snack of leftovers that have been prepared with lean meat, no additives and are low sodium. And as both my son and daughter mentioned, they can make a Breakfast Pie for themselves each morning on their commute to Uni, and save a bloody fortune by not stopping off at a fast food joint for a bite of food. The pies are sturdy, stay hot/warm forever, and can easily be held in a napkin and enjoyed \"on the go\".By telling you about all of the items that you can grab out of the frig or pantry,( if you have your crusts already made, cut out and frozen), you can have a ragingly tasty snack in exactly eight minutes. Whether sweet or savory, this little machine is truly a dream! The best compliment it could be given was that now my daughter wants one, to take back to Boston when she goes back to Uni. THAT comment put a smile on my face.  Happy Eating and Experimenting, my fellow foodies!\n",

      "\"One chews coffee beans while gargling 200 F water for four minutes; pressing with the tongue, coffee is filtered through the teeth: is this the French press you refer to?\"  M. PythonAN INTRODUCTION TO COFFEE AMBROSIA. It's a quest for flavor. It's all about flavor. You are here searching for the best quality French Press, one that delivers the most flavorful coffee possible. You might be new to French Press and are rightly skeptical about the vulnerability and safety of a glass model. Or, you might be experienced, a Bodum or BonJour refugee exasperated by having to replace your second, or third, or even your seventh broken glass beaker. No cuts? Lucky you. Been there. Below: First is a look at buying a French Press, followed by a Review of the Frieling French Press, then info on grinders, accessories, buying coffee, and brewing the best French Press. SHOPPING FOR A FRENCH PRESS: WHAT TO LOOK FORFIRST, WHAT IS FRENCH PRESS? Call it French Press, Press Pot, Cafetiere, Plunger Pot, Pressed Coffee, Coffee Press, or Cafe a Piston, it is all the same. Invented by an Italian man, popularized in France, \"French Press\" has emigrated to North America. The apparatus itself is strikingly simple: A handled pot, a lid, and a plunger. A French Press can be made of glass, metal, plastic, or ceramic. The pot is never placed on a stove burner...hot water is poured over ground coffee and steeped a few minutes, the plunger is pressed down, the brewed coffee is then poured into cups. French Press is a handson brewing method that allows the user to control brewing variables, adjusting for personal taste. This is a fullimmersion brewing method where the bed of grounds can steep, or soak, for a few minutes prior to pressing to terminate the brewing, thereby remarkably intensifying the brew's flavors and aromas when properly brewed using proper equipment. Usually, coarsely ground coffee beans are poured into the Press followed by offtheboil water, allowed to steep about four minutes at the correct temperature, then the pistonlike, porous filter plunger is slowly pressed down to filter and separate the grounds from the brewed coffee just prior to serving. A simple ritual indeed. In order to brew French Press you need a French Press. So, for shrewd shopping, French Press design features are discussed below...SIMPLICITY. No unnecessary parts means less parts to fail or to clean. ROBUST CONSTRUCTION: Your pot,lid and plunger should be of sturdy, durable construction using rustfree metals such as foodgrade stainless steel, high impact, BPAfree plastics, borosilicate glass, or quality ceramics with foodsafe glazes. The most durable, heavyduty quality is heavyduty restaurant/hotel commercial grade rather than the far less durable, lightduty consumer grade. INSULATION: Coffee Science has confirmed that coffee should be brewed at between 195 and 205 degrees F during the ENTIRE brewing cycle to release as much flavor and aroma as possible. The brewing cycle is usually four minutes for French Press. To keep temperatures within this range during the brewing cycle requires an INSULATED French Press. French Press designs that will do so are: thermal doublewall stainless or glass, thickwall ceramic designs, or inexpensive \"thermos\" designs. A heads up: An INSULATED French Press is a dedicated coffee BREWER, and is NOT a coffee storage vessel designed to store coffee after brewing...therefore it should NOT be confused with an INSULATED \"thermos,\" a design dedicated only to STORING hot or cold beverages. So, after brewing, immediately pour ALL coffee into cups or into an insulated thermos. This will immediately terminate brewing to avoid overextraction, producing a bitter cup. DISHWASHER SAFE. Ensure that your Press is dishwasher safe, and is easy to clean if handwashed. Look for hidden corners or crevices. Insist on dishwasher safe highheat resistant materials. EFFECTIVE FILTER. Your plunger's filter screen, the metal mesh, must filter, or separate, coffee grounds from the brewed coffee. The finer the screen the better it does so, BUT, and I mean the BIG BUT...no matter how good your grinder is, or your filter, some very fine particles will always make it through the filter, ending up at the bottom of your cup. It cannot be helped. Why?Because if the screen is too fine, almost solid, all grounds might be filtered out, but then it might be impossible to push the plunger to the bottom because of the resistance encountered when coffee cannot pass through the filter, yet if the filter screen is too porous then the amount of \"fines\" coming through the filter screen will markedly increase. The solution?Aside from optimal filter porosity, a quality burr grinder is key in reducing to a minimum the amount of \"fines\" coming into your cup. Even still, do not take the last sip...a bit of silt in the cup is a French Press thing...part of its reality, part of its pleasure...the price you pay for excellence in the cup. COMFORTABLE, SECURE HANDLE. You need a comfortable, secure, insulated handle. Look for a handle with a horizontal grip for the thumb and clearance for the fingers. Your handle should stay cool, especially when pouring. Its grip design should be comfy and encourage a confident, accurate pour. STABLE POT. Your Press should be stable enough to resist accidental tipping when struck: A Press can have tall proportions IF the weight is substantial. A base smaller that the width at any point is not a good design. DRIPLESS SPOUT. Your French Press should never drip or dribble when pouring...return it if it does so. Good design prevents that. SAFE TO USE. Your Press must be safe to use when not fully awake in the morning. As you know, accidents and fumbles can happen, so avoid materials that might shatter, crack, or injure you, as well as needing replacement. Only foodgrade 18/5 or the better 18/10 stainless steel should be used. Glass beakers should be highheat resistant, Pyrex type borosilicate glass. If plastics are used, ensure that they are foodsafe, BPAfree, and are not porous enough to harbor bacteria (or harbor stale coffee tastes and aromas). If ceramics are used, ensure that the glazes are food safe, cadmium and cobaltfree, or FDA approved. MATCHING YOUR FRENCH PRESS SIZE TO YOUR DESIRED COFFEE SERVING SIZEBUY THE RIGHT SIZE FOR YOUR DESIRED SERVING SIZE : When brewing fill the press no higher than an inch or more from the brim, or to the V at the bottom of the spout. This reduces capacity, but prevents coffee ejecting from the spout when pressing down. Room MUST be allowed for the halfinch to oneinch thick CO2 caused foamy \"bloom\" to rise, the water displacement of the plunger and spillage room. Do not forget the volume of the grounds either, and the 24 ounces of water retained by the grounds after pouring. Because of the facts mentioned above, any \"tothebrim\" capacity claimed by the maker must be adjusted downward by at least 26 fl. oz., in proportion to the size of the press. This goes for ALL brands and models of French Press products. For example, Frieling's stated capacities are often confusing and not clearly defined, so you might need to contact Freiling to ask questions prior to purchase, or read the below. Do so when shopping Bodum, BonJour, Frieling, or any brand of French Press. To eliminate confusion, you need to know the actual, always lesser, YIELD of served coffee in fluid ounces, not the maximum capacity, to the brim, of the French Presses you are comparing. If in doubt, go larger. A REVIEW OF THE FRIELING FRENCH PRESSPROS:1) FRIELING OWNERS HERE ON AMAZON VOTE IT 4.7 STARS, 94% POSITIVE. You might have noticed that only a few products on Amazon are rated that highly.2) FRIELING MAKES FIVE SIZES FOR YOUR DESIRED PORTION SIZE. Frieling's stated sizes are at full capacity, but it is prudent to reduce that maximum capacity by about 26 fluid ounces, depending upon the size chosen, to allow space for the plunger and the inevitable rising head of bloomfoam when hot water hits the ground coffee. Accordingly, Frieling makes FIVE sizes to suit your capacity needs: 8 fl/oz, 16 fl/oz, 23 fl/oz, 36 fl/oz, and 44 fl/oz.3) DOUBLEWALL THERMAL INSULATION. Frieling makes only one model, the Ultimo, in polished or brushed finish. ALL its three main elements are hollow, doublewall insulated: the pot, the handle, AND the lid. So far, it is the only brand or model of French Press, with one exception, to possesses ALL three featuresthe insulated LID in particular. Such insulation will keep your brewing coffee at 195205 degrees F during the entire brewing cycle resulting in maximum flavor and aroma, as verified by the Specialty Coffee Association of America. FrielingUSA states that such insulation retains heat four times longer than a glass French press.4) 18/10 STAINLESS, COMMERCIALGRADE DURABILITY. Unique to Frieling, this heavy duty French Press is made of food grade, foodsafe solid stainless steel, 18/10 (18% chromium, 10% nickel: best quality), heavy gauge stainless steel stock. This quality, special alloy is foodsafe and leadfree, meant for commercial use in hotel roomservice and hotel dining rooms, for finecuisine restaurants, for caterers, and is sold to specialty, highend hotel/restaurant supply houses (still Frieling's primary business). Such high quality steel NEVER rusts or stains, and I mean NEVER. Also, it will never shatter or injure you. Survives dishwasher hell, and comes out looking like new. The Frieling was once under the radar. It is now available to the public at better coffeeware or kitchenware stores, and is available here on Amazon, far from its industrial roots. The interior is brushed, and because the stainless walls are solid all the way through, the plunger cannot scratch off any \"coating\" because there is no coating...so nothing can rust...as so many other reviewers here have confirmed. Neither the high speed metal brushed finish nor the mirror finish will affect its nonrust qualities...it is just a cosmetic thing.5) ITS FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION. Discipline and restraint, with utility in mind, results in the Frieling's handsome, elegant, and understated lines. Appearance has been given a slight nod. It's all business. Even its high polish is not there to WOW at, but to make it easier to clean. There are no false touches present; only the authentic remains. The entire achievement makes it presentable for casual entertaining, even for more formal occasions. A matching sugar and creamer, with spoon, is available. Its tall, slightly narrow profile has a small footprint, taking up little space on the counter or the table. Shopper's note: Confusing an insulated Press with an insulated carafe is a very common blunder. ANY brand of thermal insulated French Press is specifically designed as a brewer, NOT as a thermal carafe or thermos, so brewed coffee MUST be poured into cups IMMEDIATELY after the four minute brewing period or the continued steeping will produce, even if over a minute, an overextracted, bitter, and insipid cup! For leftover coffee, use a preheated thermal carafe or thermos, with a screwon sealed lid, specifically designed to store hot coffee, and to keep it hot, after it is brewed. Actually, it is best not to store coffee. Consume coffee within 1015 minutes for the best flavor. For more coffee simply brew more coffee for the best flavor.6) THE POT'S SMALL SPOUT is dripless due to its lipped design. Not a stray drop on the tablecloth yet after four years of daily use. The spout is small enough to lose minimal heat, and I tested the heat loss by plugging the spout with window pane putty and measured only a one degree F heat loss compared to an open spout when brewing. It therefore needs no mechanism to close the spout. You will discover that the spout is large enough for a quick, steepstopping pour.7) THE INSULATED LID is entirely unique. It is, with one exception, the only INSULATED lid for a French Press to be found by any manufacturer. Heat rises, and as far as heat is concerned, the pot functions as a chimney, focusing heat above, and its opening is where most heat is lost. This lid caps the heat with its tight fit and insulation. The lid's underside dome shape helps assist in that, like a domed teakettle. The overall lid design is critical if you care to brew at the proper 195205 degree F temperature. THIS WAS THE FINAL KICKER IN MY DECISION TO CHOOSE THE FRIELING, along with the other goodies.8) THE INSULATED HANDLE is crafted of hollow, extruded stainless, all of a piece, to keep it cool, as well as to keep it llight weight so as not to unsteady the pot. The handle's vertical upright is ovoid in crosssection to provide comfort for the gripping fingers. A secure niche for the thumb is provided with its horizontal thumb rest and thumbblock. An often overlooked feature in cup or French Press design, because if the thumb rests on on a horizontal support, especially if that support is provided with a means of blocking the thumb from slipping off, one's grip is then very secure indeed. Take a look at the photo of the handle on this site, you'll see it. The long, vertical provides plenty of clearance for the fingers, and is angled inward toward the bottom to secure the fingers, also to provide good leverage when pouring.9) THE PLUNGER, when pushed down, results in a dynamic turbulence that agitates the water and grounds to intensify flavors...this is the heart of the Press, and what makes French Press what it is. It also separates the grounds from the coffee, so it is fitted to precise specifications to minimize stray grounds coming through the filter or from between the pot's inner walls and the periphery of the plunger, and thence into the cup. The unit is entirely crafted from 18/10 stainless steel (the best grade)...no plastic parts to retain stale tastes whatsoever. Easy to dissemble for cleaning and spare parts are always available. Remember, with ANY French Press you will have stray grounds, especially if you buy canned coffee because it is always ground too fine for French Press, or if you use anything but a burr grinder. Even so, tiny grounds sneak in...French Pressists never sip that last sip: don't blame the Frieling Press, or a Bodum, or a BonJour.10) REPLACEMENT PARTS AND EXCHANGES FOR VALID PROBLEMS ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE. My online and telephone experience with Frieling USA has been excellent. They will replace any product or part you feel is defective. Also, down the line, parts such as the filter screen. cross plate, spiral plate of the plunger assembly, or the plunger rod, are available at very reasonable prices.11) FRIELING KEEPS GOOD COMPANY. Beside Amazon, the finest, most prestigious online coffee gear retailers carry it: cateringplanet, wholelattelove, seattlecoffeegear, clivecoffee, terroircoffee, williamssonoma, espressozone, shop. illy, chriscoffee, liquidplanet, roaste, crateandbarrel, coffee. become, coffeebydesign, coffeeart, veniacoffee, greentreecoffee, blacksmithcoffee, wayfair, etc.12) USEFUL FOR MAKING \"OPEN POT\" COFFEE. You can also use this for \"OPEN POT\" brewing, the simple, \"connoisseur's method,\" also called \"Cowboy Coffee.\" With this method, you simply dose a pot with coffee, pour in offboil water, and steep with the lid on, but with the plunger extended just, stir three times during the steep, after the four minute steep pour through a fine filter into your cup. The flavor is similar to French Pressed coffee.13) USEFUL AS AN INSULATED SERVING PITCHER FOR HOT OR COLD DRINKS. Use the Freiling for serving cold juices, milk, or ice water; use it for serving hot syrup, hot chocolate, hot milk, etc.14) EASY TO CLEAN. The Freiling is dishwasher safe and that will remove any water spots or fingerprints with ease. The plunger filter assembly does not need to be taken apart to clean. Handwashing is often used when camping. Coffee oils build up on grinders and coffee makers of any kind...same here. So, periodically, when you see a thin brown film, use a watervinegar solution and let soak overnight, then scrub well. CONS:1) THE LID CAN SLIP FORWARD A BIT WHEN POURING: The lid is snug for pressing, but while pouring, the lid can slip forward a half inch or so. Solutionthe \"teapot pour\", the way waitstaff use it: with the finger(s) of one hand, lightly press down on the lid, the other hand grips the handle to pour. Or, use the \"onehand pour\": grip the handle with your fingers, press down lightly with side of your thumb upon the flat of the lid's back edge, or use the index finger as another reviewer here mentioned, then pour...easy and secure. If you are extremely heatsensitive just use a potholder to hold to lid. I never need to, and neither do my Frieling French Press using friends, including my daughter.2) A FEW SMALL PARTICLES OF GRIND CAN CATCH IN THE PLUNGER, in the tiny screen seam. SolutionIf that happens, then after brewing and rinsing out your Frieling, fill with hot water, replace lid and plunger. Then, pumping vigorously up and down a few times, the turbulence removes the particles. I seldom have to do that twice or use a small brush. Then place the pot and plunger in the dishwasher.3) FRIELING'S SIZING IS CONFUSING CUSTOMERS: Capacities of Frieling's presses are often expressed in two capacities: he \"serving\" capacity and the \"maximum capacity\" when used as a serving carafe for liquids other than coffee. Very often the \"serving capacity\" is not accurate, serving less than the amount stated. Moreover, various vendors, Amazon sellers, and other retailers list the same model at different capacities. It is maddening. Not only that, but most customers do not know that the \"cups\" Frieling and all coffee manufacturers refer to are actually the European \"Tasse\" cup of 4.22 fluid oz each (1/8 liter, 125ml), NOT the US 8oz measuring cup, so customers often feel misinformed when coffee servings are HALF what they expected. Frieling is innocent of misrepresentation here: it is customer ignorance that is at fault. Regardless, Frieling needs to address this issue ASAP and give us the ACTUAL YIELD per serving, in US fluid ounces, of each size offered. CONCLUSIONThe Frieling French presses are a commercial, industrial design with commercialgrade stainless, insulated everywhere, including the lid, easier to clean than with plastic parts that also retain flavors. Holds the brew temperature at the correct SCAA recommended 195205 degrees, the most important brewing feature of all. Dishwasher hardy and cleanup is easy. Handsome and presentable for entertaining. Durable to the maximum. Excellent, all stainless plunger, few stray particles, produces minimal silt. Highly recommended. 4.8 Amazon stars.

LA CAFETIERE THERMIQUE 8c, $35, 4.2 stars: NO plastics, INSULATED LID, drips, MIXED REVIEWS, stable. P.S. Most of the above brands and models, Bodum and BonJour in particular, I respect for their overall quality, if not for the plastic parts. They, and Frieling, all make similar coffee, but with varying degrees of insulation efficiency and thus very noticeable flavorintensity outcomes. Being consumergrade products, they are not expected to be as durable as commercialgrade equivalents, such as Frieling, due to their intended work environment. Consequently, their comparison with the Frieling is a bit unfair...like comparing apples to oranges. Always buy commercial products whenever possible...the tough guys. By the way, if you remain loyal to glassbeakered Presses, the doubleglass wall, insulated version of the iconic Bodum Chambord 8c ($80) is available (being that glass holds in heat better than metal, I can recommend it), but a replacement beaker is $50, $130 total Amazon. If insulation is not important to you, the glass beakered, single walled, Bodum Eileen ($67 Amazon for the 8c), with its \"full metal perforated jacket\" of stainless, is widely used in French restaurants and bistros as a commercial Press; it is fairly durable for a single wall Press due to the metal sheath, but its single wall will NOT keep the brew at the right temperature. A REBUTTAL OF THE MOST COMMON CRITICAL REVIEWS, AND SOME OVER THE TOP ONESTHE COMMON ONES1) \"Some grounds and silt bypass the filter and are in my cup.\" Answer: some will always pass through, it is a French Press thing, common to all brands and models...French Pressists never take that last sip. But there are three ways to dramatically reduce that, 1) the fault, almost invariably, USING A WHIRLYBLADE GRINDER, or the LACK OF A CONICAL BURR GRINDER that allows you to grind EVENLY and COARSELY, no more dustandboulders; or b) not grinding COARSELY enough with any grinder; or c) buying CANNED OR PACKAGED PREGROUND coffee ground FINE for drip coffee so that fine grounds can bypass the French Press's filter. Grind mediumcourse for French Press, not\" fine. If you have no good grinder then have your coffee source grind it coarsely for you.2) \"My coffee does not stay hot very long after I pour it.\" Answer: ANY brand of French Press is designed to BREW coffee, and NOT TO STORE IT. Period. Stainless Steel, or glass, doublewalled Presses are designed to keep the brewing coffee at the correct temperature (195205 degrees) DURING THE BREW CYCLE and are NOT MEANT TO STORE COFFEE AFTER THE BREW CYCLE IS COMPLETED. If the steep goes much past 4 minutes you get nasty coffeeoverextracted and bitter. I am convinced that the confusion comes from mistaking what it looks like: an insulated pot \"looks\" like a thermos, or insulated carafe. Well, it's not. It's a brewer. Timing is critical when making any coffee. Espresso Baristas use a timer to cut short their pull at 2530 seconds per shot, with French Press (and drip) set your timer to 3.5 to 4.5 minutes per extraction (4 minutes is the sweet spot).3)\"I get this metallic taste (or bitter taste, or stale taste, take your pick).\" Stainless steel, especially foodgrade 18/10 stainless used in the Frieling, is famed for imparting ZERO taste to food or beverages. It's what it's known for. The offtastes come from other sources such as, a) coffeol oil and collagen residues adhering to the Press wall, or in your grinder, or both...keep them clean, or 2) certain coffees give off unusual flavor notes also, or c) your water might be less than ideal, or d) your dishwash detergent is not thoroughly rinsed off. It's NOT the metal itself. THE OVERTHETOP ONES\"The handle breaks off,\" or \"has a sloppy weld.\" Or, \"Cannot clean the thing at all.\" Or, \"I get gray powder on my paper towel when I wipe it out.\" Answer: These are over the top, spoiler, dealkilling statements and are intended to be so, for various malicious reasons, I remain convinced, and so utterly lacking in truth that they are laughable. The laserweld on the handle is so secure that the restaurant supply managers I personally know say they have never experienced any handle failures or sloppy welds, none, ever. Dirty Stainless is not 18/10 stainless's fault, so if really neglected use foodservice's favorite: Barkeeper's Friend, use it gently, rinse. Lastly...\"It shows fingerprints all the time, and spots\"...uh, well, wipe them off, how hard is that? Or sell it on ebay and buy the new matte brushedfinish Frieling. Gray powder on the inside? Not possible with 18/10 Stainless...has to be bad water or bad dishwashing detergent, come on, think of a better pot shot. Frieling's positive 4 & 5 star reviews are 94% of the total here. That is highly unusual on Amazon. So don't worry, the $75 is only about $10 more than the lesser Bodums you might be shopping. It is money well spent, lasting for many, many years. I cherish my Frieling, and so will you. THE COFFEE HOUSE FRENCH PRESS BREW METHOD: The Hows and Whys USE CLEAN, COLD WATER. Brewing with a French Press is simple and easy. You have to know how to do it and WHY you are doing it to extract the most flavor possible. Essentially, your water flavor must be good so you begin by using cold, filtered water. You fill your kettle with TWICE the water needed: half to prewarm your Press and the other half for brewing. USE THE RIGHT DOSE OF COFFEE BEANS. Dose coffee beans at 5565g of coffee beans per liter of water, or 70 grams if you \"break and clean\" (rather than stirring the bloom, you break the bloom foam cake and spoon out the surface grounds to reduce the fines, in which case you sacrifice some brewing grounds, so you need to overdose a bit).  Use a kitchen scale to measure. BEGIN GRINDING THE BEANS JUST BEFORE THE WATER BOILS. Once the bean husk is cracked open favor immediately escapes, so wait until the last minute to grind, just as the water begins to boil. BREW AT THE CORRECT TEMPERATURE.  As the water almost boils, start your grinder, prewarm your Press with half the offboil water, empty the Press and fill with the grounds weighed on a scale. Then pour in the other half of the water, using a scale to measure, at about 205208 degrees F so as the temperature drops during the brew you are NEVER brewing lower than 195 degrees F. NEVER begin at 195 degrees F or flavor really suffers as the temp at brew's end can even drop to 185 degrees F...not good! BREW FOR THE CORRECT TIME. A fourminute brew cycle is highly recommended. Anything less gives you a raw, underextracted cup, anything more gives you an overcooked, overextracted, bitter cup. At Brew's end, ALWAYS pour out coffee into cups to terminate the brewing. NEVER store coffee in any coffee brewer as it will continue to brew! Even with drip brewing coffee is stored in a carafe...do that same here. A coffee brewer of any kind is NOT a coffee storage carafe. That is a job for a thermally insulated carafe. The insulation in a French Press is there to keep the brew at the correct temperature DURING the brew cycle. BREWING IT: An upclose look at brewing French Press Coffee1. FILL KETTLE with at least TWICE the water needed to brew. Use only fresh, neverboiled, COLD, FILTERED water, not the nasty tasting, mildly rusty hot water sitting inside your hot water heater. Now begin heating your water at high heat.2. WEIGH YOUR BEANS. While the water heats, place your grinder's groundscollecting bin on your scales, then tare to zero. After weighing, pour the beans into the grinder's hopper, then place the grounds bin in the grinder to catch the grounds when you grind.3. GRIND YOUR BEANS. Set your grinder to a mid coarse setting, as coarse as coarsely ground pepper, and experiment to get the dosage just right for your taste...I like the finer side of coarse.  When your water almost boils, at about 210211 degrees F, turn off the heat and start your grinder and let the water temp drop a bit in the meantime.4. WEIGH WATER AS YOU POUR, THEN STEEP. While the grinder is grinding, pour hot water into your Press to warm it.  When the grinding is completed, pour the warming water from the Press into your cup(s) to prewarm them, discard remaining water from the Press. Then pour your coffee grounds to the Press and place your Press on your scales, tare the Press to zero. To monitor heat place a thermometer in your Press. Now pour in the kettle's remaining 205208 degree F water into the Press as shown on your scale (I use 870900g in my 1 liter Press). Place the lid on the Press with plunger extended upward to begin the brewing cycle. Set your timer to 4 minutes.5. STIR, SINK, OR SCOOP OFF THE BLOOM. After after one minute, either gently stir, or sink the bloom with a spoon, or remove (break) the cake \"crust\" with a soup spoon (or two) to gently scoop to remove (clean) the bloom off the top to reduce the amount of fines in the brew. Be sure no grounds remain above the plunger or in the spout as those grounds will end up in your cup.6. REPLACE THE LID AND FINISH BREWING. With the lid on, continue to brew until the timer beeps, then press the plunger down VERY SLOWLY to the bottom (to reduce agitation of any fines present). Pour out the warming water from your cup(s), THEN pour in the hot coffee from the Press to replace it. Serve and enjoy. This is the ambrosia people are talking about...properly made French Press. Hoping to cover all the bases, and to eliminate any confusion, I have gone into great detail so you know not only HOW to properly make French Press, but also WHY you make it that way. Making French Press is actually a very simple ritual once you do it a few times, much simpler than it appears in the above. NOTE: The French Press pictured above is the highly regarded doublewalled insulated Frieling Ultimo French Press made of 100% 18/10 stainless steel with a stainless steel lid and parts..no plastic parts in the lid or filter plunger. The Frieling is a fine hotel and restaurant grade product available in five sizes. Available in mirror polished or brushed matte finishes.

      "\"One chews coffee beans while gargling 200 F water for four minutes; pressing with the tongue, coffee is filtered through the teeth: is this the French press you refer to?\"  M. PythonAN INTRODUCTION TO COFFEE AMBROSIA. It's a quest for flavor. It's all about flavor. You are here searching for the best quality French Press, one that delivers the most flavorful coffee possible. You might be new to French Press and are rightly skeptical about the vulnerability and safety of a glass model. Or, you might be experienced, a Bodum or BonJour refugee exasperated by having to replace your second, or third, or even your seventh broken glass beaker. No cuts? Lucky you. Been there. Below: First is a look at buying a French Press, followed by a Review of the Frieling French Press, then info on grinders, accessories, buying coffee, and brewing the best French Press. SHOPPING FOR A FRENCH PRESS: WHAT TO LOOK FORFIRST, WHAT IS FRENCH PRESS? Call it French Press, Press Pot, Cafetiere, Plunger Pot, Pressed Coffee, Coffee Press, or Cafe a Piston, it is all the same. Invented by an Italian man, popularized in France, \"French Press\" has emigrated to North America. The apparatus itself is strikingly simple: A handled pot, a lid, and a plunger. A French Press can be made of glass, metal, plastic, or ceramic. The pot is never placed on a stove burner...hot water is poured over ground coffee and steeped a few minutes, the plunger is pressed down, the brewed coffee is then poured into cups. French Press is a handson brewing method that allows the user to control brewing variables, adjusting for personal taste. This is a fullimmersion brewing method where the bed of grounds can steep, or soak, for a few minutes prior to pressing to terminate the brewing, thereby remarkably intensifying the brew's flavors and aromas when properly brewed using proper equipment. Usually, coarsely ground coffee beans are poured into the Press followed by offtheboil water, allowed to steep about four minutes at the correct temperature, then the pistonlike, porous filter plunger is slowly pressed down to filter and separate the grounds from the brewed coffee just prior to serving. A simple ritual indeed. In order to brew French Press you need a French Press. So, for shrewd shopping, French Press design features are discussed below...SIMPLICITY. No unnecessary parts means less parts to fail or to clean. ROBUST CONSTRUCTION: Your pot,lid and plunger should be of sturdy, durable construction using rustfree metals such as foodgrade stainless steel, high impact, BPAfree plastics, borosilicate glass, or quality ceramics with foodsafe glazes. The most durable, heavyduty quality is heavyduty restaurant/hotel commercial grade rather than the far less durable, lightduty consumer grade. INSULATION: Coffee Science has confirmed that coffee should be brewed at between 195 and 205 degrees F during the ENTIRE brewing cycle to release as much flavor and aroma as possible. The brewing cycle is usually four minutes for French Press. To keep temperatures within this range during the brewing cycle requires an INSULATED French Press. French Press designs that will do so are: thermal doublewall stainless or glass, thickwall ceramic designs, or inexpensive \"thermos\" designs. A heads up: An INSULATED French Press is a dedicated coffee BREWER, and is NOT a coffee storage vessel designed to store coffee after brewing...therefore it should NOT be confused with an INSULATED \"thermos,\" a design dedicated only to STORING hot or cold beverages. So, after brewing, immediately pour ALL coffee into cups or into an insulated thermos. This will immediately terminate brewing to avoid overextraction, producing a bitter cup. DISHWASHER SAFE. Ensure that your Press is dishwasher safe, and is easy to clean if handwashed. Look for hidden corners or crevices. Insist on dishwasher safe highheat resistant materials. EFFECTIVE FILTER. Your plunger's filter screen, the metal mesh, must filter, or separate, coffee grounds from the brewed coffee. The finer the screen the better it does so, BUT, and I mean the BIG BUT...no matter how good your grinder is, or your filter, some very fine particles will always make it through the filter, ending up at the bottom of your cup. It cannot be helped. Why?Because if the screen is too fine, almost solid, all grounds might be filtered out, but then it might be impossible to push the plunger to the bottom because of the resistance encountered when coffee cannot pass through the filter, yet if the filter screen is too porous then the amount of \"fines\" coming through the filter screen will markedly increase. The solution?Aside from optimal filter porosity, a quality burr grinder is key in reducing to a minimum the amount of \"fines\" coming into your cup. Even still, do not take the last sip...a bit of silt in the cup is a French Press thing...part of its reality, part of its pleasure...the price you pay for excellence in the cup. COMFORTABLE, SECURE HANDLE. You need a comfortable, secure, insulated handle. Look for a handle with a horizontal grip for the thumb and clearance for the fingers. Your handle should stay cool, especially when pouring. Its grip design should be comfy and encourage a confident, accurate pour. STABLE POT. Your Press should be stable enough to resist accidental tipping when struck: A Press can have tall proportions IF the weight is substantial. A base smaller that the width at any point is not a good design. DRIPLESS SPOUT. Your French Press should never drip or dribble when pouring...return it if it does so. Good design prevents that. SAFE TO USE. Your Press must be safe to use when not fully awake in the morning. As you know, accidents and fumbles can happen, so avoid materials that might shatter, crack, or injure you, as well as needing replacement. Only foodgrade 18/5 or the better 18/10 stainless steel should be used. Glass beakers should be highheat resistant, Pyrex type borosilicate glass. If plastics are used, ensure that they are foodsafe, BPAfree, and are not porous enough to harbor bacteria (or harbor stale coffee tastes and aromas). If ceramics are used, ensure that the glazes are food safe, cadmium and cobaltfree, or FDA approved. MATCHING YOUR FRENCH PRESS SIZE TO YOUR DESIRED COFFEE SERVING SIZEBUY THE RIGHT SIZE FOR YOUR DESIRED SERVING SIZE : When brewing fill the press no higher than an inch or more from the brim, or to the V at the bottom of the spout. This reduces capacity, but prevents coffee ejecting from the spout when pressing down. Room MUST be allowed for the halfinch to oneinch thick CO2 caused foamy \"bloom\" to rise, the water displacement of the plunger and spillage room. Do not forget the volume of the grounds either, and the 24 ounces of water retained by the grounds after pouring. Because of the facts mentioned above, any \"tothebrim\" capacity claimed by the maker must be adjusted downward by at least 26 fl. oz., in proportion to the size of the press. This goes for ALL brands and models of French Press products. For example, Frieling's stated capacities are often confusing and not clearly defined, so you might need to contact Freiling to ask questions prior to purchase, or read the below. Do so when shopping Bodum, BonJour, Frieling, or any brand of French Press. To eliminate confusion, you need to know the actual, always lesser, YIELD of served coffee in fluid ounces, not the maximum capacity, to the brim, of the French Presses you are comparing. If in doubt, go larger. A REVIEW OF THE FRIELING FRENCH PRESSPROS:1) FRIELING OWNERS HERE ON AMAZON VOTE IT 4.7 STARS, 94% POSITIVE. You might have noticed that only a few products on Amazon are rated that highly.2) FRIELING MAKES FIVE SIZES FOR YOUR DESIRED PORTION SIZE. Frieling's stated sizes are at full capacity, but it is prudent to reduce that maximum capacity by about 26 fluid ounces, depending upon the size chosen, to allow space for the plunger and the inevitable rising head of bloomfoam when hot water hits the ground coffee. Accordingly, Frieling makes FIVE sizes to suit your capacity needs: 8 fl/oz, 16 fl/oz, 23 fl/oz, 36 fl/oz, and 44 fl/oz.3) DOUBLEWALL THERMAL INSULATION. Frieling makes only one model, the Ultimo, in polished or brushed finish. ALL its three main elements are hollow, doublewall insulated: the pot, the handle, AND the lid. So far, it is the only brand or model of French Press, with one exception, to possesses ALL three featuresthe insulated LID in particular. Such insulation will keep your brewing coffee at 195205 degrees F during the entire brewing cycle resulting in maximum flavor and aroma, as verified by the Specialty Coffee Association of America. FrielingUSA states that such insulation retains heat four times longer than a glass French press.4) 18/10 STAINLESS, COMMERCIALGRADE DURABILITY. Unique to Frieling, this heavy duty French Press is made of food grade, foodsafe solid stainless steel, 18/10 (18% chromium, 10% nickel: best quality), heavy gauge stainless steel stock. This quality, special alloy is foodsafe and leadfree, meant for commercial use in hotel roomservice and hotel dining rooms, for finecuisine restaurants, for caterers, and is sold to specialty, highend hotel/restaurant supply houses (still Frieling's primary business). Such high quality steel NEVER rusts or stains, and I mean NEVER. Also, it will never shatter or injure you. Survives dishwasher hell, and comes out looking like new. The Frieling was once under the radar. It is now available to the public at better coffeeware or kitchenware stores, and is available here on Amazon, far from its industrial roots. The interior is brushed, and because the stainless walls are solid all the way through, the plunger cannot scratch off any \"coating\" because there is no coating...so nothing can rust...as so many other reviewers here have confirmed. Neither the high speed metal brushed finish nor the mirror finish will affect its nonrust qualities...it is just a cosmetic thing.5) ITS FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION. Discipline and restraint, with utility in mind, results in the Frieling's handsome, elegant, and understated lines. Appearance has been given a slight nod. It's all business. Even its high polish is not there to WOW at, but to make it easier to clean. There are no false touches present; only the authentic remains. The entire achievement makes it presentable for casual entertaining, even for more formal occasions. A matching sugar and creamer, with spoon, is available. Its tall, slightly narrow profile has a small footprint, taking up little space on the counter or the table. Shopper's note: Confusing an insulated Press with an insulated carafe is a very common blunder. ANY brand of thermal insulated French Press is specifically designed as a brewer, NOT as a thermal carafe or thermos, so brewed coffee MUST be poured into cups IMMEDIATELY after the four minute brewing period or the continued steeping will produce, even if over a minute, an overextracted, bitter, and insipid cup! For leftover coffee, use a preheated thermal carafe or thermos, with a screwon sealed lid, specifically designed to store hot coffee, and to keep it hot, after it is brewed. Actually, it is best not to store coffee. Consume coffee within 1015 minutes for the best flavor. For more coffee simply brew more coffee for the best flavor.6) THE POT'S SMALL SPOUT is dripless due to its lipped design. Not a stray drop on the tablecloth yet after four years of daily use. The spout is small enough to lose minimal heat, and I tested the heat loss by plugging the spout with window pane putty and measured only a one degree F heat loss compared to an open spout when brewing. It therefore needs no mechanism to close the spout. You will discover that the spout is large enough for a quick, steepstopping pour.7) THE INSULATED LID is entirely unique. It is, with one exception, the only INSULATED lid for a French Press to be found by any manufacturer. Heat rises, and as far as heat is concerned, the pot functions as a chimney, focusing heat above, and its opening is where most heat is lost. This lid caps the heat with its tight fit and insulation. The lid's underside dome shape helps assist in that, like a domed teakettle. The overall lid design is critical if you care to brew at the proper 195205 degree F temperature. THIS WAS THE FINAL KICKER IN MY DECISION TO CHOOSE THE FRIELING, along with the other goodies.8) THE INSULATED HANDLE is crafted of hollow, extruded stainless, all of a piece, to keep it cool, as well as to keep it llight weight so as not to unsteady the pot. The handle's vertical upright is ovoid in crosssection to provide comfort for the gripping fingers. A secure niche for the thumb is provided with its horizontal thumb rest and thumbblock. An often overlooked feature in cup or French Press design, because if the thumb rests on on a horizontal support, especially if that support is provided with a means of blocking the thumb from slipping off, one's grip is then very secure indeed. Take a look at the photo of the handle on this site, you'll see it. The long, vertical provides plenty of clearance for the fingers, and is angled inward toward the bottom to secure the fingers, also to provide good leverage when pouring.9) THE PLUNGER, when pushed down, results in a dynamic turbulence that agitates the water and grounds to intensify flavors...this is the heart of the Press, and what makes French Press what it is. It also separates the grounds from the coffee, so it is fitted to precise specifications to minimize stray grounds coming through the filter or from between the pot's inner walls and the periphery of the plunger, and thence into the cup. The unit is entirely crafted from 18/10 stainless steel (the best grade)...no plastic parts to retain stale tastes whatsoever. Easy to dissemble for cleaning and spare parts are always available. Remember, with ANY French Press you will have stray grounds, especially if you buy canned coffee because it is always ground too fine for French Press, or if you use anything but a burr grinder. Even so, tiny grounds sneak in...French Pressists never sip that last sip: don't blame the Frieling Press, or a Bodum, or a BonJour.10) REPLACEMENT PARTS AND EXCHANGES FOR VALID PROBLEMS ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE. My online and telephone experience with Frieling USA has been excellent. They will replace any product or part you feel is defective. Also, down the line, parts such as the filter screen. cross plate, spiral plate of the plunger assembly, or the plunger rod, are available at very reasonable prices.11) FRIELING KEEPS GOOD COMPANY. Beside Amazon, the finest, most prestigious online coffee gear retailers carry it: cateringplanet, wholelattelove, seattlecoffeegear, clivecoffee, terroircoffee, williamssonoma, espressozone, shop. illy, chriscoffee, liquidplanet, roaste, crateandbarrel, coffee. become, coffeebydesign, coffeeart, veniacoffee, greentreecoffee, blacksmithcoffee, wayfair, etc.12) USEFUL FOR MAKING \"OPEN POT\" COFFEE. You can also use this for \"OPEN POT\" brewing, the simple, \"connoisseur's method,\" also called \"Cowboy Coffee.\" With this method, you simply dose a pot with coffee, pour in offboil water, and steep with the lid on, but with the plunger extended just, stir three times during the steep, after the four minute steep pour through a fine filter into your cup. The flavor is similar to French Pressed coffee.13) USEFUL AS AN INSULATED SERVING PITCHER FOR HOT OR COLD DRINKS. Use the Freiling for serving cold juices, milk, or ice water; use it for serving hot syrup, hot chocolate, hot milk, etc.14) EASY TO CLEAN. The Freiling is dishwasher safe and that will remove any water spots or fingerprints with ease. The plunger filter assembly does not need to be taken apart to clean. Handwashing is often used when camping. Coffee oils build up on grinders and coffee makers of any kind...same here. So, periodically, when you see a thin brown film, use a watervinegar solution and let soak overnight, then scrub well. CONS:1) THE LID CAN SLIP FORWARD A BIT WHEN POURING: The lid is snug for pressing, but while pouring, the lid can slip forward a half inch or so. Solutionthe \"teapot pour\", the way waitstaff use it: with the finger(s) of one hand, lightly press down on the lid, the other hand grips the handle to pour. Or, use the \"onehand pour\": grip the handle with your fingers, press down lightly with side of your thumb upon the flat of the lid's back edge, or use the index finger as another reviewer here mentioned, then pour...easy and secure. If you are extremely heatsensitive just use a potholder to hold to lid. I never need to, and neither do my Frieling French Press using friends, including my daughter.2) A FEW SMALL PARTICLES OF GRIND CAN CATCH IN THE PLUNGER, in the tiny screen seam. SolutionIf that happens, then after brewing and rinsing out your Frieling, fill with hot water, replace lid and plunger. Then, pumping vigorously up and down a few times, the turbulence removes the particles. I seldom have to do that twice or use a small brush. Then place the pot and plunger in the dishwasher.3) FRIELING'S SIZING IS CONFUSING CUSTOMERS: Capacities of Frieling's presses are often expressed in two capacities: he \"serving\" capacity and the \"maximum capacity\" when used as a serving carafe for liquids other than coffee. Very often the \"serving capacity\" is not accurate, serving less than the amount stated. Moreover, various vendors, Amazon sellers, and other retailers list the same model at different capacities. It is maddening. Not only that, but most customers do not know that the \"cups\" Frieling and all coffee manufacturers refer to are actually the European \"Tasse\" cup of 4.22 fluid oz each (1/8 liter, 125ml), NOT the US 8oz measuring cup, so customers often feel misinformed when coffee servings are HALF what they expected. Frieling is innocent of misrepresentation here: it is customer ignorance that is at fault. Regardless, Frieling needs to address this issue ASAP and give us the ACTUAL YIELD per serving, in US fluid ounces, of each size offered. CONCLUSIONThe Frieling French presses are a commercial, industrial design with commercialgrade stainless, insulated everywhere, including the lid, easier to clean than with plastic parts that also retain flavors. Holds the brew temperature at the correct SCAA recommended 195205 degrees, the most important brewing feature of all. Dishwasher hardy and cleanup is easy. Handsome and presentable for entertaining. Durable to the maximum. Excellent, all stainless plunger, few stray particles, produces minimal silt. Highly recommended. 4.8 Amazon stars.

LA CAFETIERE THERMIQUE 8c, $35, 4.2 stars: NO plastics, INSULATED LID, drips, MIXED REVIEWS, stable. P.S. Most of the above brands and models, Bodum and BonJour in particular, I respect for their overall quality, if not for the plastic parts. They, and Frieling, all make similar coffee, but with varying degrees of insulation efficiency and thus very noticeable flavorintensity outcomes. Being consumergrade products, they are not expected to be as durable as commercialgrade equivalents, such as Frieling, due to their intended work environment. Consequently, their comparison with the Frieling is a bit unfair...like comparing apples to oranges. Always buy commercial products whenever possible...the tough guys. By the way, if you remain loyal to glassbeakered Presses, the doubleglass wall, insulated version of the iconic Bodum Chambord 8c ($80) is available (being that glass holds in heat better than metal, I can recommend it), but a replacement beaker is $50, $130 total Amazon. If insulation is not important to you, the glass beakered, single walled, Bodum Eileen ($67 Amazon for the 8c), with its \"full metal perforated jacket\" of stainless, is widely used in French restaurants and bistros as a commercial Press; it is fairly durable for a single wall Press due to the metal sheath, but its single wall will NOT keep the brew at the right temperature. A REBUTTAL OF THE MOST COMMON CRITICAL REVIEWS, AND SOME OVER THE TOP ONESTHE COMMON ONES1) \"Some grounds and silt bypass the filter and are in my cup.\" Answer: some will always pass through, it is a French Press thing, common to all brands and models...French Pressists never take that last sip. But there are three ways to dramatically reduce that, 1) the fault, almost invariably, USING A WHIRLYBLADE GRINDER, or the LACK OF A CONICAL BURR GRINDER that allows you to grind EVENLY and COARSELY, no more dustandboulders; or b) not grinding COARSELY enough with any grinder; or c) buying CANNED OR PACKAGED PREGROUND coffee ground FINE for drip coffee so that fine grounds can bypass the French Press's filter. Grind mediumcourse for French Press, not\" fine. If you have no good grinder then have your coffee source grind it coarsely for you.2) \"My coffee does not stay hot very long after I pour it.\" Answer: ANY brand of French Press is designed to BREW coffee, and NOT TO STORE IT. Period. Stainless Steel, or glass, doublewalled Presses are designed to keep the brewing coffee at the correct temperature (195205 degrees) DURING THE BREW CYCLE and are NOT MEANT TO STORE COFFEE AFTER THE BREW CYCLE IS COMPLETED. If the steep goes much past 4 minutes you get nasty coffeeoverextracted and bitter. I am convinced that the confusion comes from mistaking what it looks like: an insulated pot \"looks\" like a thermos, or insulated carafe. Well, it's not. It's a brewer. Timing is critical when making any coffee. Espresso Baristas use a timer to cut short their pull at 2530 seconds per shot, with French Press (and drip) set your timer to 3.5 to 4.5 minutes per extraction (4 minutes is the sweet spot).3)\"I get this metallic taste (or bitter taste, or stale taste, take your pick).\" Stainless steel, especially foodgrade 18/10 stainless used in the Frieling, is famed for imparting ZERO taste to food or beverages. It's what it's known for. The offtastes come from other sources such as, a) coffeol oil and collagen residues adhering to the Press wall, or in your grinder, or both...keep them clean, or 2) certain coffees give off unusual flavor notes also, or c) your water might be less than ideal, or d) your dishwash detergent is not thoroughly rinsed off. It's NOT the metal itself. THE OVERTHETOP ONES\"The handle breaks off,\" or \"has a sloppy weld.\" Or, \"Cannot clean the thing at all.\" Or, \"I get gray powder on my paper towel when I wipe it out.\" Answer: These are over the top, spoiler, dealkilling statements and are intended to be so, for various malicious reasons, I remain convinced, and so utterly lacking in truth that they are laughable. The laserweld on the handle is so secure that the restaurant supply managers I personally know say they have never experienced any handle failures or sloppy welds, none, ever. Dirty Stainless is not 18/10 stainless's fault, so if really neglected use foodservice's favorite: Barkeeper's Friend, use it gently, rinse. Lastly...\"It shows fingerprints all the time, and spots\"...uh, well, wipe them off, how hard is that? Or sell it on ebay and buy the new matte brushedfinish Frieling. Gray powder on the inside? Not possible with 18/10 Stainless...has to be bad water or bad dishwashing detergent, come on, think of a better pot shot. Frieling's positive 4 & 5 star reviews are 94% of the total here. That is highly unusual on Amazon. So don't worry, the $75 is only about $10 more than the lesser Bodums you might be shopping. It is money well spent, lasting for many, many years. I cherish my Frieling, and so will you. THE COFFEE HOUSE FRENCH PRESS BREW METHOD: The Hows and Whys USE CLEAN, COLD WATER. Brewing with a French Press is simple and easy. You have to know how to do it and WHY you are doing it to extract the most flavor possible. Essentially, your water flavor must be good so you begin by using cold, filtered water. You fill your kettle with TWICE the water needed: half to prewarm your Press and the other half for brewing. USE THE RIGHT DOSE OF COFFEE BEANS. Dose coffee beans at 5565g of coffee beans per liter of water, or 70 grams if you \"break and clean\" (rather than stirring the bloom, you break the bloom foam cake and spoon out the surface grounds to reduce the fines, in which case you sacrifice some brewing grounds, so you need to overdose a bit). Use a kitchen scale to measure. BEGIN GRINDING THE BEANS JUST BEFORE THE WATER BOILS. Once the bean husk is cracked open favor immediately escapes, so wait until the last minute to grind, just as the water begins to boil. I can recommend Baratza grinders, by the way. BREW AT THE CORRECT TEMPERATURE. As the water almost boils, start your grinder, prewarm your Press with half the offboil water, empty the Press and fill with the grounds weighed on a scale. Then pour in the other half of the water, using a scale to measure, at about 205208 degrees F so as the temperature drops during the brew you are NEVER brewing lower than 195 degrees F. NEVER begin at 195 degrees F or flavor really suffers as the temp at brew's end can even drop to 185 degrees F...not good! BREW FOR THE CORRECT TIME. A fourminute brew cycle is highly recommended. Anything less gives you a raw, underextracted cup, anything more gives you an overcooked, overextracted, bitter cup. At Brew's end, ALWAYS pour out coffee into cups to terminate the brewing. NEVER store coffee in any coffee brewer as it will continue to brew! Even with drip brewing coffee is stored in a carafe...do that same here. A coffee brewer of any kind is NOT a coffee storage carafe. That is a job for a thermally insulated carafe. The insulation in a French Press is there to keep the brew at the correct temperature DURING the brew cycle. BREWING IT: An Upclose Look at Brewing French Press Coffee1. FILL KETTLE with at least TWICE the water needed to brew. Use only fresh, neverboiled, COLD, FILTERED water, not the nasty tasting, mildly rusty hot water sitting inside your hot water heater. Now begin heating your water at high heat.2. WEIGH YOUR BEANS. While the water heats, place your grinder's groundscollecting bin on your scales, then tare to zero. After weighing, pour the beans into the grinder's hopper, then place the grounds bin in the grinder to catch the grounds when you grind.3. GRIND YOUR BEANS. Set your grinder to a mid coarse setting, as coarse as coarsely ground pepper, and experiment to get the dosage just right for your taste...I like the finer side of coarse. When your water almost boils, at about 210211 degrees F, turn off the heat and start your grinder and let the water temp drop a bit in the meantime.4. WEIGH WATER AS YOU POUR, THEN STEEP. While the grinder is grinding, pour hot water into your Press to warm it. When the grinding is completed, pour the warming water from the Press into your cup(s) to prewarm them, discard remaining water from the Press. Then pour your coffee grounds to the Press and place your Press on your scales, tare the Press to zero. To monitor heat place a thermometer in your Press. Now pour in the kettle's remaining 205208 degree F water into the Press as shown on your scale (I use 870900g in my 1 liter Press). Place the lid on the Press with plunger extended upward to begin the brewing cycle. Set your timer to 4 minutes.5. STIR, SINK, OR SCOOP OFF THE BLOOM. After after one minute, either gently stir, or sink the bloom with a spoon, or remove (break) the cake \"crust\" with a soup spoon (or two) to gently scoop to remove (clean) the bloom off the top to reduce the amount of fines in the brew. Be sure no grounds remain above the plunger or in the spout as those grounds will end up in your cup.6. REPLACE THE LID AND FINISH BREWING. With the lid on, continue to brew until the timer beeps, then press the plunger down VERY SLOWLY to the bottom (to reduce agitation of any fines present). Pour out the warming water from your cup(s), THEN pour in the hot coffee from the Press to replace it. Serve and enjoy. This is the ambrosia people are talking about...properly made French Press. Note: Hoping to cover all the bases, and to eliminate any confusion, I have gone into great detail here so you know not only HOW to properly make French Press, but also WHY you make it that way. Making French Press is actually a very simple ritual once you do it a few times, much, much simpler than it appears in the above. NOTE: The French Press pictured above is the highly regarded doublewalled insulated Frieling Ultimo French Press made of 100% 18/10 stainless steel with a stainless steel lid and parts..no plastic parts in the lid or filter plunger. The Frieling is a fine hotel and restaurant grade product available in five sizes. Available in mirror polished or brushed matte finishes.

      "I spent over a year researching a wide variety of juicers, and watched more demonstration videos that I could ever count.  Once or twice, I almost wish I never took this dogged challenge because all the facts, comparisons between the various juicers, and advice from others who reviewed their own product spun my head in ways I never thought possible.  And it is because of my extensive research, that I'm posting a somewhat lengthy review, which I will update from time to time as I continue to work this wonderful machine. I originally bought this machine because I planned on juicing hard fibrous vegetables, and my research from various sources showed this to be the best juicer for greens, which best suited my personal needs.  But realistically, it can do so much more. Ironically, even though I bought it for the greens, when writing this review, it is autumn, and grapes are in season, and so I got a bushel of concord grapes from a farm for a great price.  So my first juice wasn't the kale, or Swiss chard, or celery that I spent all season growing, but the concord grapes.  And I'll be damned if that wasn't the best thing I ever drank.  Mind you, because I was juicing everything, seeds and even some stems, the final result was THICK, much like a smoothie, but still, the best I ever had.  Never again will I buy \"grape juice\" from a store after having this.  Since this was my first go at this, I made more than I could drink all at once, so I kept it in the fridge, and even on the second day, there was NO SEPERATION.  This machine is so efficient, the pulp was dry beyond belief, but still I chucked the pulp into my worm bin.  Hopefully they'll get something out of it.  I have to reiterate, this was my first attempt, and it was with in season concord grapes.  So if you try something else, your results may vary. Next came my first vegetable concoction, a V6, as opposed to a high sodium, store bought V8.  I used two large store bought carrots, an organically grown tomato from my generous neighbor, as well as several stalks of my own organically grown celery, several leaves of Swiss chard, kale, and four small Cajun Belle peppers, which also came from my garden.  In a word... \"WOW!\"  I'm really getting a better appreciation of my new best friend. Thirdly, I made apple, grape lemonade.  First I was just going to juice three granny smith apples with one half lemon, which was not pealed, and one lemon that was peeled, but then I thought, hey, add some of those seeded concord grapes.  If I quoted my reaction to this, I probably would have the review pulled.  But it was a GREAT reaction.  Just probably not one you might want your children to read, which is basically, \"Holy (Bleepity bleepity bleep bleep).\"  Of the three juices that I have made thus far, this one I have continued to make numerous times.  Part of this is due to the fresh produce selection, and part of it is due to how damn good it tastes. Putting my various tests aside, I want to address a common complaint for this juicer, which is the size of the feed chute.  Here's how I see it.  This, in my humble opinion, is one of the most efficient juicers one can buy for its price range.  Taking a little more time in prep work far outweighs the waste that you'll get from a high speed centrifugal juicer.  And the versatility of this outweighs what you can get from a vertical auger juicer, as many people have come to realize that the vertical auger juicers are far less efficient with leafy greens, plus they cannot do the myriad functions of the Omega 8006.  I've done my research on this.  Hopefully, you can benefit from it. If I ever get to the other functions of the 8006, such as nut butters and fruit sorbets, I will update this review.  I understand that it can also grind coffee beans, process flower, and mince garlic, but I neither need these functions, nor do I want to use this for such purposes because I don't want the residual smell to bleed in my other concoctions. Finally, most people are concerned about the clean up process afterwards.  Well for me, it's always a breeze.  I never actually time it, because I'm constantly distracted.  Rinse this.  Take that to the worm bin.  Rinse that.  Feed the cats.  Rinse the rest... as if you can't tell, I'm in no hurry.  The best I can give you, by means of comparison, is when I was using a centrifugal juicer with no ejection port.  To be blunt, that was a labor of unrequited love, as I was tying to better my dietary lifestyle.  Now that I have the Omega 8006, there's very little labor, AND A WHOLE LOT OF LOVE.  It is more efficient than anything I've ever used before.  Now just let me win the lottery, and I'll be the happiest person to walk the Earth. Pros: It does more than I expected, and better than I expected.  What more can I say?  Also, it has a 15 YEAR WARRANTY.  The enclosed manual says 10 years, but that is outdated. Cons: I was going to complain about the collection cups that come with the unit because they don't indicate how much juice it's collecting, but since this is a juicer review, and not a collection cup review, I feel that in retrospect it's not even important.  It would be nice if the Omega website had more detailed information on general usage and some various demos of the product, but there are a plethora of them on YouTube.  So unless I want to be an over picky person, I don't have any REAL cons. MY BOTTOM LINE: If you don't love it, send me a response letting me know how wrong you think I am about this juicer.  But if you love it, then please do the same.  I truly believe that I will get far more positive responses that negative ones. Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you.  If so, please click the \"yes\" button, so that other readers may benefit from this review, and hopefully find this review to be helpful.  Thanks. October 11th 2012 UPDATE  Frozen Sorbet. I made my first \"frozen sorbet,\" consisting of bananas and pineapple.  I started with the blank plate, but did NOT use one of the extra nozzles, and pushed through a slice of pineapple first.  The manual states, \"no nozzle needed, but may be used if desired.\"  But that just produced frozen flakes.  So I stopped, added the round nozzle, and when resuming, it created the consistency that I've seen on numerous videos.  I have to say that the machine stopped once while pushing the pineapple through, but this was user error.  No problem, I reversed the unit for a few seconds, and afterwards was able to continue.  Learn from my mistake.  More fibrous fruits like pineapple need more time to process as opposed to bananas.  I rotated pineapple with banana, so that each spoonful had both in almost every bite, which incidentally, I'm thoroughly enjoying as I type this.  Ultimately, I will chalk this up as another success as to the versatility of this machine. October 15th 2012 UPDATE. I wanted to try an experiment with this machine that I've never seen covered before on any of the demonstration videos that I've watch prior to purchasing this machine.  My thought was, if the unit can make frozen sorbets with the blank plate, why not try to make a nonfrozen paste by using the blank plate with fruits that were NOT frozen?  Seems logical, to me at least, and theoretically, my body should be able to more easily process the already broken down fiber. FAILURE.  Specifically, I do mean it was I WHO FAILED.  The manual NEVER suggests doing this, and NONE of the videos that I have watched on line show my little experiment.  And now I know why.  The blank plate does not form a tight seal with liquids, so juice spills out from the juicing port, and what I hoped would be a paste, was just a semidry mush.  The blank plate seems to be designed for semi solid, to nearly solid matter, and so, these nonfrozen items did not work. Since I was curious about this before purchasing the unit, but could not find any info on this, I thought to share this with anyone who may be wondering the same thing.  This is NOT a product defect.  It simply wasn't made for what I was trying to do, so my original rating of 5 stars still stands. I'm still in the early stages of getting to know the Omega 8006, but if you have any questions, please feel free to ask.  If I can help, I surely will.  I'm not a retailer, I just want others to be able to enjoy this great product.  And please let me know if this review and its updates have been helpful to you.  Thank you. October 31st 2012 UPDATE. I have noticed some slight wear on the auger.  For now, I'm not going to worry about this, since this could simply be part of the \"breaking in\" process.  For now, I'm not going to let it bother me, since this does have a 15 year warranty.  And sometimes, some things need a little wear and tear to break in.  But for those of you who may have recently purchased this, or are still considering it, I wanted to let you be aware of this.  I am still thoroughly happy with the 8006, and continue to use it daily without any problems. Additionally, I'd like to make aware to those who juice a lot of carrots, buy the largest quantity when possible.  My local grocery store sells a 10 pound bag for about 5 bucks.  I also want to give you a tip on the larger sized carrots.  Since you should already be aware of extra prep time needed for the 8006, I'll give you one more step that takes just a few seconds, but makes the end results easier on you and your juicer.  Cut LARGE carrots in half, lengthwise.  It's just that simple, and it only takes a few seconds.  Try a whole, large carrot, and then try a halved carrot, and see how much easier it is on the juicer, as well as for yourself pushing the halved carrot through compared to the whole one.  Depending on the girth of the carrot, the smaller ones pretty much feed themselves.  I guarantee those few extra seconds of prep will ultimately be easier on both you and the juicer. November 9th 2012 UPDATE  Making Peanut Butter. I addressed the question of making nut butters in the comments section a short while ago, but now that I have actually tried this, I wanted to share my results with those who are interested.  As stated in the comments section, nuts that have a higher oil content will produce a more creamy end product, while nuts that are low in oil will produce a product which is drier and flakey.  And so, I made peanut butter for the first time, using roasted peanuts which I shelled and skinned.  The blank plate is needed for this, and for my first test, I didn't use any of the optional nozzles.  What came out of the 8006 were buttery flakes.  So I stopped the machine, used the round nozzle, and this produced a nut butter that was more of a buttery paste, which I personally preferred.  I ran this back through the machine in an attempt to make it smoother, and it did to some extant, but noticed that running it through once more after that make little difference.  I suggest that you try to experiment with the nut of your choice as well, and perhaps a different nozzle will have better, or worse results.  Experimentation is key. Your end product will not be the same consistency as a store bought product, meaning that it will not be as creamy.  And this is due to the fact that additional oil is added to the processing of most commercially bought peanut butter.  But, this can be a good thing because you will be consuming less fat calories.  Mind you, if you do want this to be creamier, you can add oil, but at that point, it pretty much defeats the purpose of making it yourself.  In addition, you can keep this salt free by using unsalted nuts, or add some salt if you prefer. Cleaning up the parts does take more time, because of the oils and the stickiness of the peanut better, so you may want to make a larger quantity of it all at once, and store what you don't use. Ultimately, while peanut butter is NOT a health food, you can make a HEALTHIER CHOICE by making it yourself by regulating the fat and salt content.  And for that, the Omega 8006 still retains the five star rating which I originally gave it.121712 UPDATE  Wear and Cactus Pear. Wear.  As previously noted, there was some wear on the auger.  After continual use on a daily basis, I can say that my previous speculation of this being part of the breaking in process was correct.  The wear has come to a standstill, and I feel comfortable in saying that this will not be an ongoing problem. Cactus Pears.  I have watched numerous videos on the health benefits of cactus pears.  Their biggest drawback is that they have a plethora of hard seeds.  Since my first test was on Concord Grapes, which also has hard seeds, I decided to try cactus pears.  It worked flawlessly!  I have run through several of these at a time over the course of a few weeks, and never has the machine hesitated, cracked, or failed in any way.  So for those of you who are interested in juicing Cactus Pears, I recommend the Omega 8006.  Mix this with some young Thai coconut water, chill it, and let your eyes roll to the back of your head as you drink it.1713 UPDATE  Cleaning Tips I Have Not Found Anywhere Else. Using this as much as I do, I noticed that a few components slowly became a bit... unsightly.  Please feel free to utilize these tips that I had to discover on my own. The end cap has a silicone ring inside, which will eventually accumulate some crud.  If you use your 8006 as much as I do, you'll probably be embarrassed by just how awful this looks when you do get it out.  But the ring in the end cap can be cleaned.  This ring can easily be pried out with a blunt tool, and I highly recommend a blunt tool, as a knife will cut the ring.  Also, I would not recommend putting this ring in a dishwasher, since it is so small, just do it by hand, it only takes a few seconds.  Just make sure you pay attention as to what side of the ring goes face down.  It has a specific upside and downside fitting, so you'll want to make sure it goes back in the same way it came out.  In addition, the pusher has a similar silicone ring, so I suggest you remove it and clean it as well as you see fit. Now I need to draw your attention to the coupler that allows you to attach the main juicing unit to the machine itself.  Over time, it very well may start to get sticky, and not rotate into place as smoothly as it did when you first used it.  When you take off the main juicing component, you'll see that there are four Phillips head screws that keep the coupler attached to the unit.  These are easily removed, and once you do remove them, you'll probably see some unsightly gunk between these rings.  Again, I suggest washing these parts by hand.  Once they're clean and dry, reattach them, BUT DO NOT over tighten the screws.  A slightly snug fit will keep everything in place without stripping a screw or breaking these plastic pieces. I hope that these instructions will help not only those who plan on buying the Omega 8006, but help those who already have it and need to know how to deal with these uncovered maintenance practices.7613 UPDATE  Fresh Berries Sorbet. Strawberries have just ended their season, and blueberries and raspberries are coming into season, at least in my area, so I wanted to make an update.  And instead of making three updates which ultimately would be very similar, I thought I'd spare you from having to read three similar updates when they could easily be combined into one. For starters, I grow my own strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries, and though I love to eat them whole , when I purchased my 8006 last year, I wanted to make a frozen sorbet from each of these that I grow organically, even if just once.  Turns out, my \"just once\" idea turned into \"just a few times more, and more, and more.\"When it comes to making frozen sorbets out of these berries in the 8006, the same rules apply.  Keep them in the freezer until they're... well... need I say it?  Then use the blank plate along with the round nozzle.  From my experience, this combination works best. Now admittedly, if I used a little more forward thinking, I would have saved some strawberries and combined them with either or both the blueberries and raspberries, but dummy me didn't think to do that.  If you love any or all of these berries, you're going to love this a whole hell of a lot.  And while you can just as easily do this with store bought berries when they're available, I wanted to try this with what I'm growing.  After all, that's why I'm growing them, and waited until now when they're in season.  For those who do not grow their own berries, or just want to have this nearly any time of the year, good quality store bought berries will work of course. BONUS TIP: If you are so inclined, you can mix this sorbet in with nonfat Greek yogurt, or even regular plain nonfat yogurt.  I was very happy when I had the frozen sorbet, and thought \"it can't get any better than this.\"  I proved myself wrong as to how much much happier I was when I made this sorbet yogurt combo.  And yes, while you can just as easily add any of these whole berries to yogurt, which is always a better thing to do than buying some readymade yogurt products, full of who knows what, adding fresh made frozen sorbet from the 8006 to yogurt is an EXTRA SPECIAL treat that you brain and body will thank you for.72713 UPDATE  Salsa!My peppers and tomatoes are ready to harvest, so I decided to try an experiment, making salsa in the 8006.  You need to use the blank plate for this, but you do not need any of the optional nozzles.  While your salsa will come out of the end, you will still get some drippings from the juicing section, so I suggest you use both collection cups.  I won't necessarily call this a recipe, since everyone's taste is different, but I'll tell you what I used.  Tomatoes, sweet peppers, hot peppers, garlic, onion, and a tad bit of cilantro.  (I'm not a fan of cilantro, but it has its uses in small amounts for me).  Just so you know, juicy onions create a frothy foam, but you can just stir that in when it's done, and no one will ever know it was there.  If the salsa is too watery for you, and this will be based on what type of tomatoes you use, you can easily strain the salsa when you're done.  Before you know it, you'll have THE BEST and MOST FRESH, salsa ever.  I shared this with neighbors, and they either, (A) really liked it, or (B) were just being really polite by consuming the whole batch and asked for more.  Either way, it was a winner.  I dare say, once you make this, you'll NEVER buy that store bought %&# again.8113 UPDATE  Grinding Flax Seed. I've been doing some research on the health benefits of flax seed, which is high in Omega 3 fatty acids.  These help with brain function, inflammation, as well as other things, and it has become increasingly used by many people because of its beneficial properties.  The only problem with flax seed is that it has to be broken open to get the full effect of its beneficial properties.  So if you ingest it whole, and don't chew it well, you'll not absorb what it has to offer.  The good, or rather great news is, the Omega 8006 does a superb job of breaking up flax seed.  Use the blank plate, pour as much as you need, and that's it.  DONE!  How much more simple can it be?  If you like, you can run it through a second time to help break the seed down a little more, but that's not really necessary.  And cleaning this can't be any easier.  You can practically blow away all of the remaining flax residue.  I didn't even bother to rinse anything except the blank plate.  And if any residual flax residue that clung to the auger gets into my juices, it won't hurt the juice, or you, at all. So what do you do with the flax once it's been ground?  Anything.  Personally, I prefer to use it in juices, smoothies, and sorbets.  If you're making a sorbet, I recommend running the flax through before any of the produce, and then incorporate it while making the sorbet.  I don't know if you'll get the same great results if you mix it in while making a sorbet, or sprinkle it on top when done.  One important thing of note is that once it's been ground, you have to use it within a few days, or it can go rancid, so prepare only what you can use.  And so what if you have to grind this every few days, because again, it's so easy to clean afterwards. Do your brain and body a favor, add flax seed into your diet.  And do it with the 8006.8613 UPDATE  Coconuts. This is an update that I'm somewhat unwilling to post, but again, I do this for the sake of others, while I might get even more dislikers who feel my review up to this point is still NOT helpful.  How more thorough can I be, you disliking /\\$$H0L$?Firstly, it is imperative that none of the hard outer shell of the coconut gets into the juicer.  It can wreck your screen, and invalidate your warranty.  But the softer, brown, inner lining won't be a problem, and won't mess up your 8006.  And now...Flakes for baking.  I'm not a baker of sweets.  But, if you are, you can't get any better FRESH coconut flakes than if you make them yourself in the 8006.  These are, The BEST!  No contest.  You can use either a white coconut, not to be confused with a young Thai coconut, or a brown coconut.  Crack it open, and demeat it however you want, then run the pieces though the 8006 using the blank plate without any of the additional nozzles.  What you will get are fresh flakes, which are not treated or preserved with who knows what from that you would normally buy.  And these taste far better, because of this.  Because these are made fresh, by you, and have no preservatives, their shelf life is limited, and you will need to use them with a few weeks, even if kept in the fridge.  Store bought coconut garbage flakes will last for many more months because... you got it, they are full of extra chemicals that you don't want to consume. Chunky Colada.  Here's the one I think most people may not like, but I'm posting it anyway for that 1 out or 100,000 people who may like this.  For starters, I AM NOT trying to make coconut milk.  I admit full heartedly that I'm too damn lazy for that.  I drained the water from a coconut and set it aside, then ran half of the meat through the 8006 to make flakes.  Once this was done, I blended both the flakes and the coconut water together.  People who want to make coconut milk would then strain this to get rid of the chunks.  Again, I'm too damn lazy for that.  I added some ice and rum to the blender, and got a refreshing drink I can drink, and chew on.  I'll bet 99 percent of the readers won't like this idea, but if you are among the select few who do, you are going to enjoy this.  In fact, I'm drinking / chewing on one of these as I'm updating this, and I'm thoroughly enjoying it.  Although maybe it's just the rum...11713 UPDATE  A Little Over One Year Anniversary. I feel that it's important to let serious buyers to know what to expect not only after a few months, but after a year of continuous use.  And I do mean continuous.  Almost every day I have made the most of the 8006, and that's important as opposed to those who only use any appliance a few times a week, or less. Grape juice revisited.  It's grape season again, so I bought 20 pounds of Concord grapes for 25 bucks.  As such, I'm making The Second Best Grape Juice Ever.  Yes, I said second best.  I planted Concord grape vines this year, as well as a Granny Smith apple tree, so in a year or 2, probably 2, I'll be making The Best Grape Juice Ever, because it's organic and home grown.  And just as importantly, after a year of use, wear and tear, I can say by means of comparison, that the pulp from the grapes is almost as dry as when I first used the 8006 a year ago.  I don't think of this VERY MINOR reduction in the dryness of pulp as a bad thing.  The 8006 needed some time to wear in as previously stated, and the difference is so minimal, it's barely worth noting. Take it where you need it.  Yup, take that bad boy out of the kitchen.  Sounds crazy, but since this is a slow rpm juicer, and is very quiet as opposed to those high and less efficient RPM juicers, why not take it out of the kitchen?  A few days ago, time was a factor.  I wanted to make my juice, but I also wanted to watch a vid.  So I did both.  I took the 8006 into the living room, and made what I wanted while watching a show.  Or take it outside, and make juices while entertaining guests and cooking on the BBQ.  There's no need to confine yourself to the kitchen with this low noise juicer. Omega 8006 vs. the Omega NC800.  I almost lost what was left of my mind when the NC800 was released.  I had the 8006 less than a year, and then a new model was released.  Speaking from observation, I can see 2 pros, and 2 cons to the NC800.  Pros: The feed chute is larger than the 8006, which means less cutting, and the adjustable end nozzle.  If you adjust it properly, you should get more juice than the 8006.  Cons:  The juicing housing is attached to the feed chute.  I feel that this is more cumbersome to clean, and many people feel that an easy to clean machine is more favorable.  Secondly, while the adjustable nozzle may be a pro, I feel this can also be a con.  With the 8006, you simply put in your produce and have great results.  This adjustable nozzle creates a new learning curve, and personally, I rather have a more simple option which doesn't need me to overthink what I'm juicing. Hopefully this one year anniversary review will be helpful to those who not only want to buy the 8006, but wanted to know what they can expect after a year of continuous use, as well as some insight to the newer, more expensive model.12913  Update  Cranberry Juice. WOW.  I can't believe you're still reading this. I love cranberries.  I literally buy about 2 dozen bags during the short time that they are available, so the idea of making my own cranberry juice was a no brainer.  When they come straight from the bag, and not cooked, they are a perfect produce product for the 8006.  Plus, due to their size and firmness, the pusher isn't even necessary.  Three 12 ounce bags made thirty two ounces of juice.  But be aware, this juice is very, VERY tart!  And as much as I like tart, juicing a few sweet, firm apples into the mix makes this far more palatable.  And due to the firmness of the cranberries, if you want to incorporate them in a sorbet, you do not have to freeze them as you would bananas, mangoes, strawberries, etc.12414 Update  Orange Juice. Well you could knock me over with a feather on this one.  All this time I've been hearing how the Omega 8006 is optimal for hard, fibrous fruits and vegetables, and with over a year of personal experience, it has proved to be just that.  But I had 7 average sized oranges lingering in my fridge, and thought, \"what the hell?\"Using the standard juicing screen, the peeled oranges turned into 18 ounces of juice.  I only wish I had a small kitchen scale so that I could tell you what the weight of the oranges were beforehand.  But nonetheless, I was not only impressed, but flabbergasted as to why I didn't think try this sooner.  I did run the pulp through two additional times for a slightly higher yield.  Actually, I ran some of it through a third time, and found that by then, there wasn't much more the juicer could extract.  While the pulp wasn't as dry as what is typical for harder produce, I feel that it did a pretty darn good job.  Because some of the pith of the orange is working its way into the juice, you will get a thicker, more robust juice than something from the grocery store.  And personally, I prefer this.  I guess it just goes to show that just because you graduate from college, you don't have to stop experimenting. The most important reason why I tried this, and added this experience to my overly long review, is so that people who are seriously thinking about the Omega 8006, shouldn't have to worry about possibly getting an additional juicer that's specifically designed for softer fruits, unless they plan on juicing a lot those on a regular basis.  While the yield may have been greater with an Omega Vert, or some other vertical auger style juicer, which are typically recommended for fruits, the Omega 8006 shows that it is versatile enough to handle squeezing out a great tasting orange juice as well.  It is possible that the Omega NC800 can squeeze out more juice per orange than the 8006, due to its adjustable nozzle, but unless Omega wants to send me one of those to do a side by side comparison, and allow me to publish the results, I'm going to be loyal to the 8006 which has PROVED itself to me time and time again as being a one of the best, and most versatile  juicers, that any serious customer could ever have. I hope that this exhaustingly thorough, and periodically updated review, was helpful to you.  Seems like I have a few dislikers for reasons unknown, but if you have any questions, please contact me before blindly disliking me.  I'm trying to help all of those who are serious about juicing, and want to do it with te Omega 8006.  Thanks.\n",

      "OVERVIEW: As a longtime coffee snob I couldn't miss the chance to smackdown these upstart espresso wannabees. Well, more fool me. I was no match for the charms of little miss Pixie; this cheeky wench promptly staked a claim on my valuable counter space, right under the wings of old matron Silvia. BACKGROUND: I've had a Rancilio Silvia V1 for over a decade. Years ago I made the popular PID modification: a computerized thermostat for superior temperature control. I've replaced the boiler, twice, and the steam valve. I've upgraded its overpressure valve and tuned it for optimum steam pressure. I don't just grind my own beans, I buy fairtrade singleorigin 20 pound bulk bags and roast to perfection on a homemade roaster. I make at least four lattes a day, and grind through a pound of coffee a week. To be sure, the PID'ed Silvia is hardly the Rolls Royce of espresso machines, but it is the Toyota Camry: a tried and true performer; a middleofthe road favorite. The Nespresso is the new Smart Fortwo: affordable, stylish, leading edge, versatile and fun. Sure, they'll both get you where you want to go, but they're not really in the same market niche. I've been wanting to give the Nespresso a workout for a couple years, and when Amazon Vine gave me a chance to review not one, but two models, I jumped. They are: the Nespresso Pixie (C60) and the Nespresso U (D50), both with the Aeroccino Plus milk frother. To which I added the Coffeeduck refillable capsules. What follows is a comparison of all of the above versus my old standby, Silvia. SUMMARY: For a quick and tasty single shot of espresso or small cappuccino the Aeroccino frother with the Nespresso U and Pixie do a consistently good job. Compared to my Silvia, well, I've made many worse cups over the years, much worse, but, after a decade of mods and mastering technique, these days I usually make better. INTRODUCTION: To start with, let me say that the Pixie and U model ranges are not Nespresso's topoftheline but closer to introductory level. Their least to most expensive model ranges are as follows: essenza, U, PIXIE, citiz, lattissima and maestria. As to temperatures, warmup times, and taste, I couldn't detect a significant difference between the U and the Pixie models, so contrasting them comes down to aesthetics and ergonomics. If I write \"the Nespresso\" I mean either the U or Pixie models, interchangeably. Also, when I write \"cup of coffee\" versus \"espresso\" I'm merely referring to the volume of water pushed through the pod, though a purist would rightly distinguish between a Cafe Americano and a ridiculously overextracted espresso. Temperatures were taken with my Extech 22816 digital multimeter, and weights were taken with a Philips HR2394 kitchen scale. What follows is a particularly long, perhaps overlong, review. If you couldn't care less for technical comparisons, ancillary diversions, personal opinions and supplemental recipes skip to the succinct conclusion at the end. TEMPERATURE: Some people complain Nespresso temperatures are too low, and regarding a cup of coffee it's a fair criticism; though regarding a shot of espresso it's wrong. A shot of espresso was usually around 175 degrees Fahrenheit (though it could range from 165 to 180   more on that later), but a cup of coffee only reached around 155. In comparison, my Silvia's espresso temperature was around 165, but as I can set the Silvia's PID to any arbitrary temperature, that's really only relevant as a way of saying the Nespressos are right in the ballpark for espresso. However, many people recommend coffee temperature at 155175, so at 155 the Nespresso really is on the low side. VOLUME: Because a \"normal\" shot of espresso is called a \"double\", it is possible for marketing departments to do semantic gymnastics around the term \"shot of espresso\" with enough ambiguity to avoid a lawsuit. Without getting into a blizzard of definitions, let me simply assert that a single is 1oz, a double is 2oz, a triple 3oz, and what you would normally get if you ordered a shot from a barrista would be 2oz \"double\" shot of espresso. Now for some hard numbers:The Nespresso U had the following default shot volumes: small=0.75oz, medium=1.1oz, large=3.25oz. The Nespresso Pixie had these default shot volumes: small=1.55oz, and large=3.5oz (no medium button).I say \"default\" shot volumes because both models are easy to reprogram. And I eventually did so, practicing without a pod, until settling on 1oz single shots for the small button, and 4.5oz coffee cups for the large. Now, a cup of coffee is obviously larger than a shot of espresso, but even more so these days. My grandma's heirloom coffee cups, circa 1970, hold 5 ounces; the smallest for sale at Starbucks is 8 ounces; and my modern coffee mugs hold 11 ounces. The Nespresso reservoir is only 30oz, so you would get just three ten ounce cups of coffee from the entire reservoir. Be warned: temperaturewise, tastewise and capacitywise, using the Nespresso to make \"cups of coffee\" means making cups of coffee sized just right for Deputy Fife in the Mayberry Diner. ADVICE, TEMP. SURFING: Unfortunately, although the Nespresso machines do a good job of keeping the first few ounces hot, past 3 ounces temperature falls rapidly. As a practical matter, this doesn't affect me because I like the Nespresso for single shots (1oz) of espresso or small cups (4.5oz) of coffee. That gives espresso at 175 which is perfect, and coffee at 155 which is okay. Rancilio Silvia owners learn to their dismay all about temperature variability, which is why the PID is such a popular modification. But what we've learned can help Nespresso owners, too. The technique is known as \"temperature surfing\" and means operating the machine in a particular way so as to give consistent and optimum temperatures. For the Nespresso, my surfing advice is simple: always draw a large empty shot (3oz) of hot water into your cup before loading a pod and making the espresso or coffee (first tossing the hot water down the drain). This does two things. First of all, it heats the cup. Most of your expensive espresso machines have a warming tray above the boiler expressly for the purpose of keeping espresso cups hot; because a hot cup makes for better taste. The Nespresso doesn't have a warming tray, but by filling the cup with hot water you warm it up even more, plus by running a few ounces of hot water through the Nespresso you preheat its internal elements. My measurements consistently showed a 10 temperature increase from the first to second cups, following this technique. The first shot was typically 165 and the second was around 175. On a couple of occasions I managed to get shots as high as 180, but this was after dozens of consecutive pulls with hot water alone and not consistently repeatable: the fifth shot might be 180 but the sixth would be back to 175. Eventually, after 30 minutes of experimentation the cartridge hatch on the Nespresso U model was too hot too touch, but the espresso temp. remained 175.WARMUP TIME: Compared to Silvia, the Nespresso is a dream: just 30 seconds from powering on to drawing a warmup shot, after which it's as warm as it's realistically going to get. Silvia's vast bulk takes at least 10 minutes to get cosy, but preferably closer to 30. As a practical matter, I turn her on when I wake up in the morning  half an hour later she's ready to give me lattes, but I still have to draw a warmup shot first. In the best case Nespresso's time from poweron to first shot of espresso is under 2 minutes; Silvia's: over 10. As a convenience factor, this should not be overlooked. QUANTITY OF COFFEE GROUNDS: This is where I have a legitimate criticism of the Nespresso. Perhaps criticism is too strong a word, more like demystification. In any case, the criticism isn't against the Nespresso so much, as the pods. Do a little research into the subject and you'll find that an espresso \"single\" is made with grounds weighing 78 grams/single shot, whereas cups of coffee are made with 1416grams/liter (see Wikipedia articles on espresso and coffeegrounds). Probably not coincidentally my Philips kitchen scale tells me Nespresso pods contain 68 grams of coffee grounds (depending on the flavor).Translated into English that means each Nespresso pod contains the optimum quantity of grounds for a single shot (1oz) of espresso, or a 4.5oz cup of coffee. Compare Nespressos 68g of grounds to my Rancilio Silvia, for which I have three portafilter baskets with the following capacities: small=11g, medium=17g, large=22g. Most of the time I use my large triple basket and extract only double shot of espresso, which makes for a very rich shot. Not only does \"coffee theory\" tell us we should be making 1oz shots, or 4.5oz cups, with a Nespresso pod's 68g of grounds, but my taste buds do as well. Sticking with those smaller volumes the Nespresso shot flavor compares very favorably with what I get from homeroasted beans on a supermodified Silvia. But a 2.5oz espresso from Nespresso tastes overextracted; and an 8oz cup of coffee tastes weak, not to mention lukewarm and bitter. Of course, taste is personal, and if you love triple lungo shots from your Nespresso, then more power to you. But before you judge, let me give you one bit of advice: try comparing one tripleshotted pod against three singleshotted pods (one pod against three) and see if the latter isn't astoundingly better. For around ten ounces of top notch espresso Silvia costs me about a dollar a day, about ten cents per (1oz singlesized) shot. With Nespresso pods at sixty cents per 1oz singleshot pod over the course of a year the difference comes to $1800  enough to buy that Rolls Royce of espresso machines, or at least the Mercedes Benz. Of course, the reality is I would never spend that much, I'd just overextract the pods and suffer with worse coffee. One can't helping thinking of the inkjet printer: manufacturers practically giving them away then selling ink for more than its weight in gold. COFFEEDUCK PODS. One way people save money is pod adapters that can be filled at home, and I've tried the black Coffeeduck brand at seven dollars each (for the Nespresso Pixie be sure to get the black ones). The breakeven point is about 15 shots, but I'm not sure they'll last. Be warned, the Coffeeduck pod adapters won't work with the Nespresso U or any other automatic model  only the manual models like the Nespresso Pixie. Not only do the Coffeeduck directions explicitly state this, but I mistakenly tried it before reading the fine print and they're not kidding: for one terrifying moment I thought I had ruined the Nespresso U. It's one reason to prefer the Pixie. Getting the right grind with these is tricky. My Rancilio Rocky grinder must be set eight notches coarser than what I use for Silvia. I fill to the top, tamp with my finger, top off the grounds and fingertamp again. I don't know how one would use these without an expensive espresso grinder, but since I do have one they let me fill my own pods for about twelve cents apiece. A considerable savings over sixty. The tradeoff is what you might imagine: time and mess from fingertamping powdery dry grounds, then cleaning out the hot, wet, sticky grounds with a toothbrush. Still, saving fifty cents a pop, more or less, is nothing to sneeze at. The espresso quality is top notch, every bit as good as Nespresso's Pods as long as I grind fresh and brew immediately. There is no advantage in prefilling a bunch of them, as they go stale in less than a day just like any espresso grounds. This is one area where the Nespresso pods have a real advantage. With their airtight seal and special gases they keep fresh for, as far as I know, forever. MILK FROTHING. First off, let me say that I absolutely adore the Aeroccino frother, and I wouldn't even consider buying a Nespresso without one. The simple reason is hot chocolate. Oh, and it's good for coffeebased milk drinks, too. Using the Aeroccino is simplicity itself. Pour in  cup of 47 milk, press the button, and 60 seconds later it stops itself  now pour out frothy 145 milk for your cappuccino. Pour in 1 full cup of 47 milk, press the button, and 120 seconds later you have frothy 145 milk for your latte. Cleanup is 53 seconds with hot water rinse and a paper towel wipe. Now, those are good numbers, but, in a headtohead faceoff, the Silvia really shines in this department. Unfortunately, before it shines it has to warmup. First give it 60 seconds to heat up from espresso stage to steamer stage. At that point  cup of  47 milk heats to 160 in a mere 30 seconds. Meaning that on the first  cup Silvia is 30 seconds slower than the Aeroccino but 15 hotter. Thereafter no reheat time is required, and Silvia heats twice as fast as the Aeroccino, or given the same amount of time, heats 30 warmer. Even better, if I don't care about getting the world's best microfoam I can put a twocup pitcher of cold milk under the Silvia and walk away, returning several minutes later to a full pint of hot, slightly frothy milk for multiple lattes. Silvia's 115 second cleanup time is twice as long as the Aeroccino's 53 seconds. Where I expected the Aeroccino to fall short is in making quality microfoam, and to a certain extent I right to worry, but it's not as bad as I feared. If you stick with only  cup of milk you can use the larger of the two Aeroccino paddles (the unused one stores conveniently on the underside of the lid) and it gives decent foam. By the way, they aren't kidding when they say not to use the large paddle with 1 full cup of milk  I tried, and got milk all over the place, like putting too much soap in the clothes washer. Anyway, the larger paddle makes for a nice quantity of froth. It's not exactly microfoam (look it up on Wikipedia), but it's not bad. Needless to say, I can get perfect microfoam from Silvia, but to get it I have to stand there nursing the pitcher, and to be honest I don't usually bother. COCOA. This is the Aeroccino's forte. I've been looking for something like this for years, and The Aeroccino does it. The secret is powered sugar. Nothing could be simpler. Secure the small paddle in the Aeroccino cup. Pour 1 full cup of cold milk into it. Add 1 heaping tablespoon of cocoa power (I've tried Hershey's, Nestle's and Ghiradelli's). Add 1 heaping tablespoon of powdered sugar. Press the button and wait for it to finish. Two minutes later you will have a perfect, unrivalled, sublime cup of hot cocoa. Pour into a drinking mug. Add a dash of vanilla, a sprinkle of cinnamon, a dollop of whipped cream or all three. If you think it's too sweet or too chocolatey, experiment with a halfteaspoon more or less of cocoa or powdered sugar, to taste, until you reach nirvana. After heating and frothing the cocoa might form a film on the bottom of the Aeroccino, and if you don't wipe it out with a wet paper towel before making another cup the Aeroccino might overheat, flashing red. When this happens you can sometimes ignore it, taking the Aeroccino off its base, putting it back on, and pressing the button again, repeating as necessary until it's hot enough to drink. To avoid this altogether just make sure to wipe away any cocoa film from the Aeroccino before making a second cup. If you use granulated sugar instead of powered sugar, then about 50% of the time the small paddle will pop off the nipple inside the Aeroccino. This is because the granulated sugar falls to the bottom of the cup and interferes with the paddle's rotation before dissolving. If this happens you will see the milk stop spinning in a whirlpool and you should press the button to turn off the Aeroccino. I won't tell you to reach in and reseat the paddle with your fingers in case its too hot, but when I've done that I haven't been burned. The paddle won't fall off twice because by that time the granulated sugar will have dissolved. To avoid this, don't add the granulated sugar at first with the cocoa, but wait until the Aeroccino has finished heating and frothing. Or just use powered sugar and forget about it. The practical upshot of this is that I now drink a cup of hot cocoa every day instead of only once a month. I make it for the kids whenever they want instead of only as a very special treat. There simply isn't any comparison to \"instant cocoa\" mix, whether it be Nestle Quick, Swiss Miss, or whatever. Those substitutes pale in comparison to the genuine article, as every hot chocolate connoisseur knows. In short, if there's a better way than the Aeroccino to make hot cocoa, I'd like to know what it is. ERGONOMICS. It's here where the only real differences appear between the Nespresso Pixie versus Nespresso U. Compared to those two, Silvia is a beast. And when you add in the size of the Silvia's coffee grinder (the Rocky) along with the necessary tray for catching loose grounds, it's safe to say the Silvia easily consumes five times as much counter space as the Nespresso on its worst day. That said, see my uploaded photograph of the various machines, which is the best way to get an impression of their relative sizes. As far as appearance goes, you know what you prefer, but for maintenance I like the smooth surface of the U versus the ridges on the Pixie. The ridges in the Pixie tend to collect coffee and milk splatters and need a meticulous scrubbing with towel or sponge to clean. Whereas the U simply wipes clean. Also, the U cleverly uses magnets to hold the cup base in place, allowing you to remove it entirely if desired. Also, the U has the delightful ability to rotate the water reservoir off to either side or directly behind, letting you customize it to your space. Both the U and the Pixie have a place underneath for storing excess power cord. Unfortunately for the U, I was much less pleased with its \"automatic\" pod handling. First of all, whenever the pod latch was opened the U eventually pumped hot water. Whether or not any pod was inserted. And not necessarily right away, but when the machine has warmed up, which might take 35 seconds. More than once I was startled by scalding hot water suddenly running out of the spout when my back was turned, because I had plugged it in, fiddled with the latch to see if anything was happening, wondered if it was, decided it wasn't, and forgot about it until whoops! better find a cup. Also, against the U, it had a considerable amount of leakage into the drip tray on every shot: 13ml, to be precise. And as the overflow cup is only 260ml that means after 20 shots your overflow cup overfloweth. It made quite a mess before I worked that out. The Pixie doesn't have that problem, leaking perhaps 1ml per shot. Worse, the automatic pod loader on the U jams up when trying to use the Coffeeduck adapter pods. Coffeeduck warns you about this, but I didn't read the fine print and tried it anyway, and it jammed. Because the U doesn't have a manual open, I wasn't sure how I was going to get the old pod out as I couldn't open the hatch, jiggling it with increasing desperation it finally broke free. Then, just to be sure, I did the same all over again  with the same result. In contrast, the Pixie is easy to open and when a Coffeeduck gets occasionally stuck a simple flick of the fingernail will break it loose. Considering that \"automatic loading\" just means not having to pull a simple lever, it's hard to understand why you'd want it. Mainly for aesthetics, I think, to get rid of the lever. But I'm a guy  I like levers. AMERICANO VS. LONG BLACK. There are two ways to get a Mayberry sized 4.5oz \"cup of coffee\" from the Nespresso: the obvious way and the better way. The obvious way is to program your large button for 4.5 ounces, stick in a pod, hit it, and drink what comes out. It tastes exactly like you'd expect from pushing 4.5oz of (underheated) steam through 1oz worth of espresso grounds: overextracted, weak and bitter espresso. Fortunately there's a better way: it's called \"The Americano\", and it's the way Silvia has always made cups of coffee for my many beloved ancestors who haven't yet cottoned on to these FrouFrou lattes and expressos (sic). An Americano, for those who don't know, is just a shot of espresso with enough hot water to make a full cup. It's surprisingly good. The Long Black is even better, and is made in the reverse order by adding the shot of espresso to the hot water, preserving more crema. To make a Long Black with the Nespresso is simplicity itself. Just program your small button for 1oz and your large for 3.5oz. After warming up the machine and your glass pour 3.5oz hot water into your cup by pressing the large button with no pod loaded. Then load the pod, wait 15 seconds, and press the small button to add a great single shot (1oz) of espresso to the hot water. Voila, a Long Black. Earlier today I did a sidebyside comparison of a 4.5oz Long Black made on the Pixie (1oz espresso shot added to 3.5oz hot water) versus a simple 4.5oz shot through a single pod. As expected, the Long Black was smoother and sweeter. In exchange for a slight decrease in \"strength\" there is a large decrease in bitterness. If a stronger cup is desired, I'd suggest trying a Long Black made from 5oz water and two single shots (2x1oz) of espresso. CONCLUSION. I'm a coffee snob who's spent countless hours roasting his own beans and nursing great espresso out of his (relatively) expensive and finicky Rancilio Silvia. I really wanted to hate the Nespresso, but I just couldn't. As long as one respects the limits imposed by a mere 7grams of coffee grounds per pod, the Nespresso U and Pixie machines are fine espresso makers. I got both to review and between them decided to keep the Pixie mostly because of its compatibility with the moneysaving Coffeeduck adapter pods. The Nespresso's quick warmup time lets my noncoffeesnob wife make herself a quick pickmeup, something she wasn't willing to do with slow and fussy Silvia. On the downside, respecting limits means pushing no more than 1oz of water through the pod: a \"single\" shot of espresso, perhaps added to no more than 3.5oz of hot water if making a \"long black\" cup of coffee. As long as one makes a podless warmup shot first, 1oz espresso shots are perfectly hot at 175; and 4.5oz cups of coffee are acceptably hot at 155. The Aeroccino makes quick work of foaming  cup milk for a cappuccino, and it does a fantastic job of making 1 full cup of hot cocoa  add in the package discount and I would never consider buying a Nespresso without an Aeroccino. Pricewise, the Nespresso package costs well under 1/3rd of my Rancilio Silvia/Rocky combo, but tastewise they aren't that far apart. On the other hand, the pods are considerably more expensive than raw beans so years from now you may wish you'd saved your quarters and gotten a highend espresso machine to begin with. NOTE REGARDING FROTHER: This review includes my take on the Aeroccino frother, even though it isn't part of this particular package. I would always opt for the frother package with the Pixie, and because of that I took 1 star off my rating for this frotherless package.\n",

      "Faceoff: Rancilio Silvia vs. Nespresso PixieOVERVIEW: As a longtime coffee snob I couldn't miss the chance to smackdown these upstart espresso wannabees. Well, more fool me. I was no match for the charms of little miss Pixie; this cheeky wench promptly staked a claim on my valuable counter space, right under the wings of old matron Silvia. BACKGROUND: I've had a Rancilio Silvia V1 for over a decade. Years ago I made the popular PID modification: a computerized thermostat for superior temperature control. I've replaced the boiler, twice, and the steam valve. I've upgraded its overpressure valve and tuned it for optimum steam pressure. I don't just grind my own beans, I buy fairtrade singleorigin 20 pound bulk bags and roast to perfection on a homemade roaster. I make at least four lattes a day, and grind through a pound of coffee a week. To be sure, the PID'ed Silvia is hardly the Rolls Royce of espresso machines, but it is the Toyota Camry: a tried and true performer; a middleofthe road favorite. The Nespresso is the new Smart Fortwo: affordable, stylish, leading edge, versatile and fun. Sure, they'll both get you where you want to go, but they're not really in the same market niche. I've been wanting to give the Nespresso a workout for a couple years, and when Amazon Vine gave me a chance to review not one, but two models, I jumped. They are: the Nespresso Pixie (C60) and the Nespresso U (D50), both with the Aeroccino Plus milk frother. To which I added the Coffeeduck refillable capsules. What follows is a comparison of all of the above versus my old standby, Silvia. SUMMARY: For a quick and tasty single shot of espresso or small cappuccino the Aeroccino frother with the Nespresso U and Pixie do a consistently good job. Compared to my Silvia, well, I've made many worse cups over the years, much worse, but, after a decade of mods and mastering technique, these days I usually make better. INTRODUCTION: To start with, let me say that the Pixie and U model ranges are not Nespresso's topoftheline but closer to introductory level. Their least to most expensive model ranges are as follows: essenza, U, PIXIE, citiz, lattissima and maestria. As to temperatures, warmup times, and taste, I couldn't detect a significant difference between the U and the Pixie models, so contrasting them comes down to aesthetics and ergonomics. If I write \"the Nespresso\" I mean either the U or Pixie models, interchangeably. Also, when I write \"cup of coffee\" versus \"espresso\" I'm merely referring to the volume of water pushed through the pod, though a purist would rightly distinguish between a Cafe Americano and a ridiculously overextracted espresso. Temperatures were taken with my Extech 22816 digital multimeter, and weights were taken with a Philips HR2394 kitchen scale. What follows is a particularly long, perhaps overlong, review. If you couldn't care less for technical comparisons, ancillary diversions, personal opinions and supplemental recipes skip to the succinct conclusion at the end. TEMPERATURE: Some people complain Nespresso temperatures are too low, and regarding a cup of coffee it's a fair criticism; though regarding a shot of espresso it's wrong. A shot of espresso was usually around 175 degrees Fahrenheit (though it could range from 165 to 180   more on that later), but a cup of coffee only reached around 155. In comparison, my Silvia's espresso temperature was around 165, but as I can set the Silvia's PID to any arbitrary temperature, that's really only relevant as a way of saying the Nespressos are right in the ballpark for espresso. However, many people recommend coffee temperature at 155175, so at 155 the Nespresso really is on the low side. VOLUME: Because a \"normal\" shot of espresso is called a \"double\", it is possible for marketing departments to do semantic gymnastics around the term \"shot of espresso\" with enough ambiguity to avoid a lawsuit. Without getting into a blizzard of definitions, let me simply assert that a single is 1oz, a double is 2oz, a triple 3oz, and what you would normally get if you ordered a shot from a barrista would be 2oz \"double\" shot of espresso. Now for some hard numbers:The Nespresso U had the following default shot volumes: small=0.75oz, medium=1.1oz, large=3.25oz. The Nespresso Pixie had these default shot volumes: small=1.55oz, and large=3.5oz (no medium button).I say \"default\" shot volumes because both models are easy to reprogram. And I eventually did so, practicing without a pod, until settling on 1oz single shots for the small button, and 4.5oz coffee cups for the large. Now, a cup of coffee is obviously larger than a shot of espresso, but even more so these days. My grandma's heirloom coffee cups, circa 1970, hold 5 ounces; the smallest for sale at Starbucks is 8 ounces; and my modern coffee mugs hold 11 ounces. The Nespresso reservoir is only 30oz, so you would get just three ten ounce cups of coffee from the entire reservoir. Be warned: temperaturewise, tastewise and capacitywise, using the Nespresso to make \"cups of coffee\" means making cups of coffee sized just right for Deputy Fife in the Mayberry Diner. ADVICE, TEMP. SURFING: Unfortunately, although the Nespresso machines do a good job of keeping the first few ounces hot, past 3 ounces temperature falls rapidly. As a practical matter, this doesn't affect me because I like the Nespresso for single shots (1oz) of espresso or small cups (4.5oz) of coffee. That gives espresso at 175 which is perfect, and coffee at 155 which is okay. Rancilio Silvia owners learn to their dismay all about temperature variability, which is why the PID is such a popular modification. But what we've learned can help Nespresso owners, too. The technique is known as \"temperature surfing\" and means operating the machine in a particular way so as to give consistent and optimum temperatures. For the Nespresso, my surfing advice is simple: always draw a large empty shot (3oz) of hot water into your cup before loading a pod and making the espresso or coffee (first tossing the hot water down the drain). This does two things. First of all, it heats the cup. Most of your expensive espresso machines have a warming tray above the boiler expressly for the purpose of keeping espresso cups hot; because a hot cup makes for better taste. The Nespresso doesn't have a warming tray, but by filling the cup with hot water you warm it up even more, plus by running a few ounces of hot water through the Nespresso you preheat its internal elements. My measurements consistently showed a 10 temperature increase from the first to second cups, following this technique. The first shot was typically 165 and the second was around 175. On a couple of occasions I managed to get shots as high as 180, but this was after dozens of consecutive pulls with hot water alone and not consistently repeatable: the fifth shot might be 180 but the sixth would be back to 175. Eventually, after 30 minutes of experimentation the cartridge hatch on the Nespresso U model was too hot too touch, but the espresso temp. remained 175.WARMUP TIME: Compared to Silvia, the Nespresso is a dream: just 30 seconds from powering on to drawing a warmup shot, after which it's as warm as it's realistically going to get. Silvia's vast bulk takes at least 10 minutes to get cosy, but preferably closer to 30. As a practical matter, I turn her on when I wake up in the morning  half an hour later she's ready to give me lattes, but I still have to draw a warmup shot first. In the best case Nespresso's time from poweron to first shot of espresso is under 2 minutes; Silvia's: over 10. As a convenience factor, this should not be overlooked. QUANTITY OF COFFEE GROUNDS: This is where I have a legitimate criticism of the Nespresso. Perhaps criticism is too strong a word, more like demystification. In any case, the criticism isn't against the Nespresso so much, as the pods. Do a little research into the subject and you'll find that an espresso \"single\" is made with grounds weighing 78 grams/single shot, whereas cups of coffee are made with 1416grams/liter (see Wikipedia articles on espresso and coffeegrounds). Probably not coincidentally my Philips kitchen scale tells me Nespresso pods contain 68 grams of coffee grounds (depending on the flavor).Translated into English that means each Nespresso pod contains the optimum quantity of grounds for a single shot (1oz) of espresso, or a 4.5oz cup of coffee. Compare Nespressos 68g of grounds to my Rancilio Silvia, for which I have three portafilter baskets with the following capacities: small=11g, medium=17g, large=22g. Most of the time I use my large triple basket and extract only double shot of espresso, which makes for a very rich shot. Not only does \"coffee theory\" tell us we should be making 1oz shots, or 4.5oz cups, with a Nespresso pod's 68g of grounds, but my taste buds do as well. Sticking with those smaller volumes the Nespresso shot flavor compares very favorably with what I get from homeroasted beans on a supermodified Silvia. But a 2.5oz espresso from Nespresso tastes overextracted; and an 8oz cup of coffee tastes weak, not to mention lukewarm and bitter. Of course, taste is personal, and if you love triple lungo shots from your Nespresso, then more power to you. But before you judge, let me give you one bit of advice: try comparing one tripleshotted pod against three singleshotted pods (one pod against three) and see if the latter isn't astoundingly better. For around ten ounces of top notch espresso Silvia costs me about a dollar a day, about ten cents per (1oz singlesized) shot. With Nespresso pods at sixty cents per 1oz singleshot pod over the course of a year the difference comes to $1800  enough to buy that Rolls Royce of espresso machines, or at least the Mercedes Benz. Of course, the reality is I would never spend that much, I'd just overextract the pods and suffer with worse coffee. One can't helping thinking of the inkjet printer: manufacturers practically giving them away then selling ink for more than its weight in gold. COFFEEDUCK PODS. One way people save money is pod adapters that can be filled at home, and I've tried the black Coffeeduck brand at seven dollars each (for the Nespresso Pixie be sure to get the black ones). The breakeven point is about 15 shots, but I'm not sure they'll last. Be warned, the Coffeeduck pod adapters won't work with the Nespresso U or any other automatic model  only the manual models like the Nespresso Pixie. Not only do the Coffeeduck directions explicitly state this, but I mistakenly tried it before reading the fine print and they're not kidding: for one terrifying moment I thought I had ruined the Nespresso U. It's one reason to prefer the Pixie. Getting the right grind with these is tricky. My Rancilio Rocky grinder must be set eight notches coarser than what I use for Silvia. I fill to the top, tamp with my finger, top off the grounds and fingertamp again. I don't know how one would use these without an expensive espresso grinder, but since I do have one they let me fill my own pods for about twelve cents apiece. A considerable savings over sixty. The tradeoff is what you might imagine: time and mess from fingertamping powdery dry grounds, then cleaning out the hot, wet, sticky grounds with a toothbrush. Still, saving fifty cents a pop, more or less, is nothing to sneeze at. The espresso quality is top notch, every bit as good as Nespresso's Pods as long as I grind fresh and brew immediately. There is no advantage in prefilling a bunch of them, as they go stale in less than a day just like any espresso grounds. This is one area where the Nespresso pods have a real advantage. With their airtight seal and special gases they keep fresh for, as far as I know, forever. MILK FROTHING. First off, let me say that I absolutely adore the Aeroccino frother, and I wouldn't even consider buying a Nespresso without one. The simple reason is hot chocolate. Oh, and it's good for coffeebased milk drinks, too. Using the Aeroccino is simplicity itself. Pour in  cup of 47 milk, press the button, and 60 seconds later it stops itself  now pour out frothy 145 milk for your cappuccino. Pour in 1 full cup of 47 milk, press the button, and 120 seconds later you have frothy 145 milk for your latte. Cleanup is 53 seconds with hot water rinse and a paper towel wipe. Now, those are good numbers, but, in a headtohead faceoff, the Silvia really shines in this department. Unfortunately, before it shines it has to warmup. First give it 60 seconds to heat up from espresso stage to steamer stage. At that point  cup of  47 milk heats to 160 in a mere 30 seconds. Meaning that on the first  cup Silvia is 30 seconds slower than the Aeroccino but 15 hotter. Thereafter no reheat time is required, and Silvia heats twice as fast as the Aeroccino, or given the same amount of time, heats 30 warmer. Even better, if I don't care about getting the world's best microfoam I can put a twocup pitcher of cold milk under the Silvia and walk away, returning several minutes later to a full pint of hot, slightly frothy milk for multiple lattes. Silvia's 115 second cleanup time is twice as long as the Aeroccino's 53 seconds. Where I expected the Aeroccino to fall short is in making quality microfoam, and to a certain extent I right to worry, but it's not as bad as I feared. If you stick with only  cup of milk you can use the larger of the two Aeroccino paddles (the unused one stores conveniently on the underside of the lid) and it gives decent foam. By the way, they aren't kidding when they say not to use the large paddle with 1 full cup of milk  I tried, and got milk all over the place, like putting too much soap in the clothes washer. Anyway, the larger paddle makes for a nice quantity of froth. It's not exactly microfoam (look it up on Wikipedia), but it's not bad. Needless to say, I can get perfect microfoam from Silvia, but to get it I have to stand there nursing the pitcher, and to be honest I don't usually bother. COCOA. This is the Aeroccino's forte. I've been looking for something like this for years, and The Aeroccino does it. The secret is powered sugar. Nothing could be simpler. Secure the small paddle in the Aeroccino cup. Pour 1 full cup of cold milk into it. Add 1 heaping tablespoon of cocoa power (I've tried Hershey's, Nestle's and Ghiradelli's). Add 1 heaping tablespoon of powdered sugar. Press the button and wait for it to finish. Two minutes later you will have a perfect, unrivalled, sublime cup of hot cocoa. Pour into a drinking mug. Add a dash of vanilla, a sprinkle of cinnamon, a dollop of whipped cream or all three. If you think it's too sweet or too chocolatey, experiment with a halfteaspoon more or less of cocoa or powdered sugar, to taste, until you reach nirvana. After heating and frothing the cocoa might form a film on the bottom of the Aeroccino, and if you don't wipe it out with a wet paper towel before making another cup the Aeroccino might overheat, flashing red. When this happens you can sometimes ignore it, taking the Aeroccino off its base, putting it back on, and pressing the button again, repeating as necessary until it's hot enough to drink. To avoid this altogether just make sure to wipe away any cocoa film from the Aeroccino before making a second cup. If you use granulated sugar instead of powered sugar, then about 50% of the time the small paddle will pop off the nipple inside the Aeroccino. This is because the granulated sugar falls to the bottom of the cup and interferes with the paddle's rotation before dissolving. If this happens you will see the milk stop spinning in a whirlpool and you should press the button to turn off the Aeroccino. I won't tell you to reach in and reseat the paddle with your fingers in case its too hot, but when I've done that I haven't been burned. The paddle won't fall off twice because by that time the granulated sugar will have dissolved. To avoid this, don't add the granulated sugar at first with the cocoa, but wait until the Aeroccino has finished heating and frothing. Or just use powered sugar and forget about it. The practical upshot of this is that I now drink a cup of hot cocoa every day instead of only once a month. I make it for the kids whenever they want instead of only as a very special treat. There simply isn't any comparison to \"instant cocoa\" mix, whether it be Nestle Quick, Swiss Miss, or whatever. Those substitutes pale in comparison to the genuine article, as every hot chocolate connoisseur knows. In short, if there's a better way than the Aeroccino to make hot cocoa, I'd like to know what it is. ERGONOMICS. It's here where the only real differences appear between the Nespresso Pixie versus Nespresso U. Compared to those two, Silvia is a beast. And when you add in the size of the Silvia's coffee grinder (the Rocky) along with the necessary tray for catching loose grounds, it's safe to say the Silvia easily consumes five times as much counter space as the Nespresso on its worst day. That said, see my uploaded photograph of the various machines, which is the best way to get an impression of their relative sizes. As far as appearance goes, you know what you prefer, but for maintenance I like the smooth surface of the U versus the ridges on the Pixie. The ridges in the Pixie tend to collect coffee and milk splatters and need a meticulous scrubbing with towel or sponge to clean. Whereas the U simply wipes clean. Also, the U cleverly uses magnets to hold the cup base in place, allowing you to remove it entirely if desired. Also, the U has the delightful ability to rotate the water reservoir off to either side or directly behind, letting you customize it to your space. Both the U and the Pixie have a place underneath for storing excess power cord. Unfortunately for the U, I was much less pleased with its \"automatic\" pod handling. First of all, whenever the pod latch was opened the U eventually pumped hot water. Whether or not any pod was inserted. And not necessarily right away, but when the machine has warmed up, which might take 35 seconds. More than once I was startled by scalding hot water suddenly running out of the spout when my back was turned, because I had plugged it in, fiddled with the latch to see if anything was happening, wondered if it was, decided it wasn't, and forgot about it until whoops! better find a cup. Also, against the U, it had a considerable amount of leakage into the drip tray on every shot: 13ml, to be precise. And as the overflow cup is only 260ml that means after 20 shots your overflow cup overfloweth. It made quite a mess before I worked that out. The Pixie doesn't have that problem, leaking perhaps 1ml per shot. Worse, the automatic pod loader on the U jams up when trying to use the Coffeeduck adapter pods. Coffeeduck warns you about this, but I didn't read the fine print and tried it anyway, and it jammed. Because the U doesn't have a manual open, I wasn't sure how I was going to get the old pod out as I couldn't open the hatch, jiggling it with increasing desperation it finally broke free. Then, just to be sure, I did the same all over again  with the same result. In contrast, the Pixie is easy to open and when a Coffeeduck gets occasionally stuck a simple flick of the fingernail will break it loose. Considering that \"automatic loading\" just means not having to pull a simple lever, it's hard to understand why you'd want it. Mainly for aesthetics, I think, to get rid of the lever. But I'm a guy  I like levers. AMERICANO VS. LONG BLACK. There are two ways to get a Mayberry sized 4.5oz \"cup of coffee\" from the Nespresso: the obvious way and the better way. The obvious way is to program your large button for 4.5 ounces, stick in a pod, hit it, and drink what comes out. It tastes exactly like you'd expect from pushing 4.5oz of (underheated) steam through 1oz worth of espresso grounds: overextracted, weak and bitter espresso.

An Americano, for those who don't know, is just a shot of espresso with enough hot water to make a full cup. It's surprisingly good. The Long Black is even better, and is made in the reverse order by adding the shot of espresso to the hot water, preserving more crema. To make a Long Black with the Nespresso is simplicity itself. Just program your small button for 1oz and your large for 3.5oz. After warming up the machine and your glass pour 3.5oz hot water into your cup by pressing the large button with no pod loaded. Then load the pod, wait 15 seconds, and press the small button to add a great single shot (1oz) of espresso to the hot water. Voila, a Long Black. Earlier today I did a sidebyside comparison of a 4.5oz Long Black made on the Pixie (1oz espresso shot added to 3.5oz hot water) versus a simple 4.5oz shot through a single pod. As expected, the Long Black was smoother and sweeter. In exchange for a slight decrease in \"strength\" there is a large decrease in bitterness. If a stronger cup is desired, I'd suggest trying a Long Black made from 5oz water and two single shots (2x1oz) of espresso. CONCLUSION. I'm a coffee snob who's spent countless hours roasting his own beans and nursing great espresso out of his (relatively) expensive and finicky Rancilio Silvia. I really wanted to hate the Nespresso, but I just couldn't. As long as one respects the limits imposed by a mere 7grams of coffee grounds per pod, the Nespresso U and Pixie machines are fine espresso makers.

Most of your expensive espresso machines have a warming tray above the boiler expressly for the purpose of keeping espresso cups hot; because a hot cup makes for better taste. The Nespresso doesn't have a warming tray, but by filling the cup with hot water you warm it up even more, plus by running a few ounces of hot water through the Nespresso you preheat its internal elements. My measurements consistently showed a 10 temperature increase from the first to second cups, following this technique. The first shot was typically 165 and the second was around 175. On a couple of occasions I managed to get shots as high as 180, but this was after dozens of consecutive pulls with hot water alone and not consistently repeatable: the fifth shot might be 180 but the sixth would be back to 175. Eventually, after 30 minutes of experimentation the cartridge hatch on the Nespresso U model was too hot too touch, but the espresso temp. remained 175.WARMUP TIME: Compared to Silvia, the Nespresso is a dream: just 30 seconds from powering on to drawing a warmup shot, after which it's as warm as it's realistically going to get. Silvia's vast bulk takes at least 10 minutes to get cosy, but preferably closer to 30. As a practical matter, I turn her on when I wake up in the morning  half an hour later she's ready to give me lattes, but I still have to draw a warmup shot first. In the best case Nespresso's time from poweron to first shot of espresso is under 2 minutes; Silvia's: over 10. As a convenience factor, this should not be overlooked. QUANTITY OF COFFEE GROUNDS: This is where I have a legitimate criticism of the Nespresso. Perhaps criticism is too strong a word, more like demystification. In any case, the criticism isn't against the Nespresso so much, as the pods. Do a little research into the subject and you'll find that an espresso \"single\" is made with grounds weighing 78 grams/single shot, whereas cups of coffee are made with 1416grams/liter (see Wikipedia articles on espresso and coffeegrounds). Probably not coincidentally my Philips kitchen scale tells me Nespresso pods contain 68 grams of coffee grounds (depending on the flavor).Translated into English that means each Nespresso pod contains the optimum quantity of grounds for a single shot (1oz) of espresso, or a 4.5oz cup of coffee. Compare Nespressos 68g of grounds to my Rancilio Silvia, for which I have three portafilter baskets with the following capacities: small=11g, medium=17g, large=22g. Most of the time I use my large triple basket and extract only double shot of espresso, which makes for a very rich shot. Not only does \"coffee theory\" tell us we should be making 1oz shots, or 4.5oz cups, with a Nespresso pod's 68g of grounds, but my taste buds do as well. Sticking with those smaller volumes the Nespresso shot flavor compares very favorably with what I get from homeroasted beans on a supermodified Silvia. But a 2.5oz espresso from Nespresso tastes overextracted; and an 8oz cup of coffee tastes weak, not to mention lukewarm and bitter. Of course, taste is personal, and if you love triple lungo shots from your Nespresso, then more power to you. But before you judge, let me give you one bit of advice: try comparing one tripleshotted pod against three singleshotted pods (one pod against three) and see if the latter isn't astoundingly better. For around ten ounces of top notch espresso Silvia costs me about a dollar a day, about ten cents per (1oz singlesized) shot. With Nespresso pods at sixty cents per 1oz singleshot pod over the course of a year the difference comes to $1800  enough to buy that Rolls Royce of espresso machines, or at least the Mercedes Benz. Of course, the reality is I would never spend that much, I'd just overextract the pods and suffer with worse coffee. One can't helping thinking of the inkjet printer: manufacturers practically giving them away then selling ink for more than its weight in gold. COFFEEDUCK PODS. One way people save money is pod adapters that can be filled at home, and I've tried the black Coffeeduck brand at seven dollars each (for the Nespresso Pixie be sure to get the black ones). The breakeven point is about 15 shots, but I'm not sure they'll last. Be warned, the Coffeeduck pod adapters won't work with the Nespresso U or any other automatic model  only the manual models like the Nespresso Pixie. Not only do the Coffeeduck directions explicitly state this, but I mistakenly tried it before reading the fine print and they're not kidding: for one terrifying moment I thought I had ruined the Nespresso U. It's one reason to prefer the Pixie. Getting the right grind with these is tricky. My Rancilio Rocky grinder must be set eight notches coarser than what I use for Silvia. I fill to the top, tamp with my finger, top off the grounds and fingertamp again. I don't know how one would use these without an expensive espresso grinder, but since I do have one they let me fill my own pods for about twelve cents apiece. A considerable savings over sixty. The tradeoff is what you might imagine: time and mess from fingertamping powdery dry grounds, then cleaning out the hot, wet, sticky grounds with a toothbrush. Still, saving fifty cents a pop, more or less, is nothing to sneeze at. The espresso quality is top notch, every bit as good as Nespresso's Pods as long as I grind fresh and brew immediately. There is no advantage in prefilling a bunch of them, as they go stale in less than a day just like any espresso grounds. This is one area where the Nespresso pods have a real advantage. With their airtight seal and special gases they keep fresh for, as far as I know, forever. MILK FROTHING. First off, let me say that I absolutely adore the Aeroccino frother, and I wouldn't even consider buying a Nespresso without one. The simple reason is hot chocolate. Oh, and it's good for coffeebased milk drinks, too. Using the Aeroccino is simplicity itself. Pour in  cup of 47 milk, press the button, and 60 seconds later it stops itself  now pour out frothy 145 milk for your cappuccino. Pour in 1 full cup of 47 milk, press the button, and 120 seconds later you have frothy 145 milk for your latte. Cleanup is 53 seconds with hot water rinse and a paper towel wipe. Now, those are good numbers, but, in a headtohead faceoff, the Silvia really shines in this department. Unfortunately, before it shines it has to warmup. First give it 60 seconds to heat up from espresso stage to steamer stage. At that point  cup of  47 milk heats to 160 in a mere 30 seconds. Meaning that on the first  cup Silvia is 30 seconds slower than the Aeroccino but 15 hotter. Thereafter no reheat time is required, and Silvia heats twice as fast as the Aeroccino, or given the same amount of time, heats 30 warmer. Even better, if I don't care about getting the world's best microfoam I can put a twocup pitcher of cold milk under the Silvia and walk away, returning several minutes later to a full pint of hot, slightly frothy milk for multiple lattes. Silvia's 115 second cleanup time is twice as long as the Aeroccino's 53 seconds. Where I expected the Aeroccino to fall short is in making quality microfoam, and to a certain extent I right to worry, but it's not as bad as I feared. If you stick with only  cup of milk you can use the larger of the two Aeroccino paddles (the unused one stores conveniently on the underside of the lid) and it gives decent foam. By the way, they aren't kidding when they say not to use the large paddle with 1 full cup of milk  I tried, and got milk all over the place, like putting too much soap in the clothes washer. Anyway, the larger paddle makes for a nice quantity of froth. It's not exactly microfoam (look it up on Wikipedia), but it's not bad. Needless to say, I can get perfect microfoam from Silvia, but to get it I have to stand there nursing the pitcher, and to be honest I don't usually bother. COCOA. This is the Aeroccino's forte. I've been looking for something like this for years, and The Aeroccino does it. The secret is powered sugar. Nothing could be simpler. Secure the small paddle in the Aeroccino cup. Pour 1 full cup of cold milk into it. Add 1 heaping tablespoon of cocoa power (I've tried Hershey's, Nestle's and Ghiradelli's). Add 1 heaping tablespoon of powdered sugar. Press the button and wait for it to finish. Two minutes later you will have a perfect, unrivalled, sublime cup of hot cocoa. Pour into a drinking mug. Add a dash of vanilla, a sprinkle of cinnamon, a dollop of whipped cream or all three. If you think it's too sweet or too chocolatey, experiment with a halfteaspoon more or less of cocoa or powdered sugar, to taste, until you reach nirvana. After heating and frothing the cocoa might form a film on the bottom of the Aeroccino, and if you don't wipe it out with a wet paper towel before making another cup the Aeroccino might overheat, flashing red. When this happens you can sometimes ignore it, taking the Aeroccino off its base, putting it back on, and pressing the button again, repeating as necessary until it's hot enough to drink. To avoid this altogether just make sure to wipe away any cocoa film from the Aeroccino before making a second cup. If you use granulated sugar instead of powered sugar, then about 50% of the time the small paddle will pop off the nipple inside the Aeroccino. This is because the granulated sugar falls to the bottom of the cup and interferes with the paddle's rotation before dissolving. If this happens you will see the milk stop spinning in a whirlpool and you should press the button to turn off the Aeroccino. I won't tell you to reach in and reseat the paddle with your fingers in case its too hot, but when I've done that I haven't been burned. The paddle won't fall off twice because by that time the granulated sugar will have dissolved. To avoid this, don't add the granulated sugar at first with the cocoa, but wait until the Aeroccino has finished heating and frothing. Or just use powered sugar and forget about it. The practical upshot of this is that I now drink a cup of hot cocoa every day instead of only once a month. I make it for the kids whenever they want instead of only as a very special treat. There simply isn't any comparison to \"instant cocoa\" mix, whether it be Nestle Quick, Swiss Miss, or whatever. Those substitutes pale in comparison to the genuine article, as every hot chocolate connoisseur knows. In short, if there's a better way than the Aeroccino to make hot cocoa, I'd like to know what it is. ERGONOMICS. It's here where the only real differences appear between the Nespresso Pixie versus Nespresso U. Compared to those two, Silvia is a beast. And when you add in the size of the Silvia's coffee grinder (the Rocky) along with the necessary tray for catching loose grounds, it's safe to say the Silvia easily consumes five times as much counter space as the Nespresso on its worst day. That said, see my uploaded photograph of the various machines, which is the best way to get an impression of their relative sizes. As far as appearance goes, you know what you prefer, but for maintenance I like the smooth surface of the U versus the ridges on the Pixie. The ridges in the Pixie tend to collect coffee and milk splatters and need a meticulous scrubbing with towel or sponge to clean. Whereas the U simply wipes clean. Also, the U cleverly uses magnets to hold the cup base in place, allowing you to remove it entirely if desired. Also, the U has the delightful ability to rotate the water reservoir off to either side or directly behind, letting you customize it to your space. Both the U and the Pixie have a place underneath for storing excess power cord. Unfortunately for the U, I was much less pleased with its \"automatic\" pod handling. First of all, whenever the pod latch was opened the U eventually pumped hot water. Whether or not any pod was inserted. And not necessarily right away, but when the machine has warmed up, which might take 35 seconds. More than once I was startled by scalding hot water suddenly running out of the spout when my back was turned, because I had plugged it in, fiddled with the latch to see if anything was happening, wondered if it was, decided it wasn't, and forgot about it until whoops! better find a cup. Also, against the U, it had a considerable amount of leakage into the drip tray on every shot: 13ml, to be precise. And as the overflow cup is only 260ml that means after 20 shots your overflow cup overfloweth. It made quite a mess before I worked that out. The Pixie doesn't have that problem, leaking perhaps 1ml per shot. Worse, the automatic pod loader on the U jams up when trying to use the Coffeeduck adapter pods. Coffeeduck warns you about this, but I didn't read the fine print and tried it anyway, and it jammed. Because the U doesn't have a manual open, I wasn't sure how I was going to get the old pod out as I couldn't open the hatch, jiggling it with increasing desperation it finally broke free. Then, just to be sure, I did the same all over again  with the same result. In contrast, the Pixie is easy to open and when a Coffeeduck gets occasionally stuck a simple flick of the fingernail will break it loose. Considering that \"automatic loading\" just means not having to pull a simple lever, it's hard to understand why you'd want it. Mainly for aesthetics, I think, to get rid of the lever. But I'm a guy  I like levers. AMERICANO VS. LONG BLACK. There are two ways to get a Mayberry sized 4.5oz \"cup of coffee\" from the Nespresso: the obvious way and the better way. The obvious way is to program your large button for 4.5 ounces, stick in a pod, hit it, and drink what comes out. It tastes exactly like you'd expect from pushing 4.5oz of (underheated) steam through 1oz worth of espresso grounds: overextracted, weak and bitter espresso. Fortunately there's a better way: it's called \"The Americano\", and it's the way Silvia has always made cups of coffee for my many beloved ancestors who haven't yet cottoned on to these FrouFrou lattes and expressos (sic). An Americano, for those who don't know, is just a shot of espresso with enough hot water to make a full cup. It's surprisingly good. The Long Black is even better, and is made in the reverse order by adding the shot of espresso to the hot water, preserving more crema. To make a Long Black with the Nespresso is simplicity itself. Just program your small button for 1oz and your large for 3.5oz. After warming up the machine and your glass pour 3.5oz hot water into your cup by pressing the large button with no pod loaded. Then load the pod, wait 15 seconds, and press the small button to add a great single shot (1oz) of espresso to the hot water. Voila, a Long Black. Earlier today I did a sidebyside comparison of a 4.5oz Long Black made on the Pixie (1oz espresso shot added to 3.5oz hot water) versus a simple 4.5oz shot through a single pod. As expected, the Long Black was smoother and sweeter. In exchange for a slight decrease in \"strength\" there is a large decrease in bitterness. If a stronger cup is desired, I'd suggest trying a Long Black made from 5oz water and two single shots (2x1oz) of espresso. CONCLUSION. I'm a coffee snob who's spent countless hours roasting his own beans and nursing great espresso out of his (relatively) expensive and finicky Rancilio Silvia. I really wanted to hate the Nespresso, but I just couldn't. As long as one respects the limits imposed by a mere 7grams of coffee grounds per pod, the Nespresso U and Pixie machines are fine espresso makers. I got both to review and between them decided to keep the Pixie mostly because of its compatibility with the moneysaving Coffeeduck adapter pods. The Nespresso's quick warmup time lets my noncoffeesnob wife make herself a quick pickmeup, something she wasn't willing to do with slow and fussy Silvia. On the downside, respecting limits means pushing no more than 1oz of water through the pod: a \"single\" shot of espresso, perhaps added to no more than 3.5oz of hot water if making a \"long black\" cup of coffee. As long as one makes a podless warmup shot first, 1oz espresso shots are perfectly hot at 175; and 4.5oz cups of coffee are acceptably hot at 155. The Aeroccino makes quick work of foaming  cup milk for a cappuccino, and it does a fantastic job of making 1 full cup of hot cocoa  add in the package discount and I would never consider buying a Nespresso without an Aeroccino. Pricewise, the Nespresso package costs well under 1/3rd of my Rancilio Silvia/Rocky combo, but tastewise they aren't that far apart. On the other hand, the pods are considerably more expensive than raw beans so years from now you may wish you'd saved your quarters and gotten a highend espresso machine to begin with.\n",

      "\"One chews coffee beans while gargling 200 F water for four minutes; pressing with the tongue, coffee is filtered through the teeth: is this the French press you refer to?\"  M. PythonAN INTRODUCTION TO COFFEE AMBROSIA. It's a quest for flavor. It's all about flavor. You are here searching for the best quality French Press, one that delivers the most flavorful coffee possible. You might be new to French Press and are rightly skeptical about the vulnerability and safety of a glass model. Or, you might be experienced, a Bodum or BonJour refugee exasperated by having to replace your second, or third, or even your seventh broken glass beaker. No cuts? Lucky you. Been there. Below: First is a look at buying a French Press, followed by a Review of the Frieling French Press, then info on grinders, accessories, buying coffee, and brewing the best French Press. SHOPPING FOR A FRENCH PRESS: WHAT TO LOOK FORFIRST, WHAT IS FRENCH PRESS? Call it French Press, Press Pot, Cafetiere, Plunger Pot, Pressed Coffee, Coffee Press, or Cafe a Piston, it is all the same. Invented by an Italian man, popularized in France, \"French Press\" has emigrated to North America. The apparatus itself is strikingly simple: A handled pot, a lid, and a plunger. A French Press can be made of glass, metal, plastic, or ceramic. The pot is never placed on a stove burner...hot water is poured over ground coffee and steeped a few minutes, the plunger is pressed down, the brewed coffee is then poured into cups. French Press is a handson brewing method that allows the user to control brewing variables, adjusting for personal taste. This is a fullimmersion brewing method where the bed of grounds can steep, or soak, for a few minutes prior to pressing to terminate the brewing, thereby remarkably intensifying the brew's flavors and aromas when properly brewed using proper equipment. Usually, coarsely ground coffee beans are poured into the Press followed by offtheboil water, allowed to steep about four minutes at the correct temperature, then the pistonlike, porous filter plunger is slowly pressed down to filter and separate the grounds from the brewed coffee just prior to serving. A simple ritual indeed. In order to brew French Press you need a French Press. So, for shrewd shopping, French Press design features are discussed below...SIMPLICITY. No unnecessary parts means less parts to fail or to clean. ROBUST CONSTRUCTION: Your pot,lid and plunger should be of sturdy, durable construction using rustfree metals such as foodgrade stainless steel, high impact, BPAfree plastics, borosilicate glass, or quality ceramics with foodsafe glazes. The most durable, heavyduty quality is heavyduty restaurant/hotel commercial grade rather than the far less durable, lightduty consumer grade. INSULATION: Coffee Science has confirmed that coffee should be brewed at between 195 and 205 degrees F during the ENTIRE brewing cycle to release as much flavor and aroma as possible. The brewing cycle is usually four minutes for French Press. To keep temperatures within this range during the brewing cycle requires an INSULATED French Press. French Press designs that will do so are: thermal doublewall stainless or glass, thickwall ceramic designs, or inexpensive \"thermos\" designs. A heads up: An INSULATED French Press is a dedicated coffee BREWER, and is NOT a coffee storage vessel designed to store coffee after brewing...therefore it should NOT be confused with an INSULATED \"thermos,\" a design dedicated only to STORING hot or cold beverages. So, after brewing, immediately pour ALL coffee into cups or into an insulated thermos. This will immediately terminate brewing to avoid overextraction, producing a bitter cup. DISHWASHER SAFE. Ensure that your Press is dishwasher safe, and is easy to clean if handwashed. Look for hidden corners or crevices. Insist on dishwasher safe highheat resistant materials. EFFECTIVE FILTER. Your plunger's filter screen, the metal mesh, must filter, or separate, coffee grounds from the brewed coffee. The finer the screen the better it does so, BUT, and I mean the BIG BUT...no matter how good your grinder is, or your filter, some very fine particles will always make it through the filter, ending up at the bottom of your cup. It cannot be helped. Why?Because if the screen is too fine, almost solid, all grounds might be filtered out, but then it might be impossible to push the plunger to the bottom because of the resistance encountered when coffee cannot pass through the filter, yet if the filter screen is too porous then the amount of \"fines\" coming through the filter screen will markedly increase. The solution?Aside from optimal filter porosity, a quality burr grinder is key in reducing to a minimum the amount of \"fines\" coming into your cup. Even still, do not take the last sip...a bit of silt in the cup is a French Press thing...part of its reality, part of its pleasure...the price you pay for excellence in the cup. COMFORTABLE, SECURE HANDLE. You need a comfortable, secure, insulated handle. Look for a handle with a horizontal grip for the thumb and clearance for the fingers. Your handle should stay cool, especially when pouring. Its grip design should be comfy and encourage a confident, accurate pour. STABLE POT. Your Press should be stable enough to resist accidental tipping when struck: A Press can have tall proportions IF the weight is substantial. A base smaller that the width at any point is not a good design. DRIPLESS SPOUT. Your French Press should never drip or dribble when pouring...return it if it does so. Good design prevents that. SAFE TO USE. Your Press must be safe to use when not fully awake in the morning. As you know, accidents and fumbles can happen, so avoid materials that might shatter, crack, or injure you, as well as needing replacement. Only foodgrade 18/5 or the better 18/10 stainless steel should be used. Glass beakers should be highheat resistant, Pyrex type borosilicate glass. If plastics are used, ensure that they are foodsafe, BPAfree, and are not porous enough to harbor bacteria (or harbor stale coffee tastes and aromas). If ceramics are used, ensure that the glazes are food safe, cadmium and cobaltfree, or FDA approved. MATCHING YOUR FRENCH PRESS SIZE TO YOUR DESIRED COFFEE SERVING SIZEBUY THE RIGHT SIZE FOR YOUR DESIRED SERVING SIZE : When brewing fill the press no higher than an inch or more from the brim, or to the V at the bottom of the spout. This reduces capacity, but prevents coffee ejecting from the spout when pressing down. Room MUST be allowed for the halfinch to oneinch thick CO2 caused foamy \"bloom\" to rise, the water displacement of the plunger and spillage room. Do not forget the volume of the grounds either, and the 24 ounces of water retained by the grounds after pouring. Because of the facts mentioned above, any \"tothebrim\" capacity claimed by the maker must be adjusted downward by at least 26 fl. oz., in proportion to the size of the press. This goes for ALL brands and models of French Press products. For example, Frieling's stated capacities are often confusing and not clearly defined, so you might need to contact Freiling to ask questions prior to purchase, or read the below. Do so when shopping Bodum, BonJour, Frieling, or any brand of French Press. To eliminate confusion, you need to know the actual, always lesser, YIELD of served coffee in fluid ounces, not the maximum capacity, to the brim, of the French Presses you are comparing. If in doubt, go larger. A REVIEW OF THE FRIELING FRENCH PRESSPROS:1) FRIELING OWNERS ON AMAZON VOTE IT AN AVERAGE OF 4.7 STARS, 94% POSITIVE. You might have noticed that few products on Amazon are rated that highly.2) FRIELING MAKES FIVE SIZES FOR YOUR DESIRED PORTION SIZE. Frieling's stated sizes are at full capacity, but it is prudent to reduce that maximum capacity by about 26 fluid ounces, depending upon the size chosen, to allow space for the plunger and the inevitable rising head of bloomfoam when hot water hits the ground coffee. Accordingly, Frieling makes FIVE sizes to suit your capacity needs: 8 fl/oz, 16 fl/oz, 23 fl/oz, 36 fl/oz, and 44 fl/oz.3) DOUBLEWALL THERMAL INSULATION. Frieling makes only one model, the Ultimo, in polished or brushed finish. ALL its three main elements are hollow, doublewall insulated: the pot, the handle, AND the lid. So far, it is the only brand or model of French Press, with one exception, to possesses ALL three featuresthe insulated LID in particular. Such insulation will keep your brewing coffee at 195205 degrees F during the entire brewing cycle resulting in maximum flavor and aroma, as verified by the Specialty Coffee Association of America. FrielingUSA states that such insulation retains heat four times longer than a glass French press.4) 18/10 STAINLESS, COMMERCIALGRADE DURABILITY. Unique to Frieling, this heavy duty French Press is made of food grade, foodsafe solid stainless steel, 18/10 (18% chromium, 10% nickel: best quality), heavy gauge stainless steel stock. This quality, special alloy is foodsafe and leadfree, meant for commercial use in hotel roomservice and hotel dining rooms, for finecuisine restaurants, for caterers, and is sold to specialty, highend hotel/restaurant supply houses (still Frieling's primary business). Such high quality steel NEVER rusts or stains, and I mean NEVER. Also, it will never shatter or injure you. Survives dishwasher hell, and comes out looking like new. The Frieling was once under the radar. It is now available to the public at better coffeeware or kitchenware stores, and is available here on Amazon, far from its industrial roots. The interior is brushed, and because the stainless walls are solid all the way through, the plunger cannot scratch off any \"coating\" because there is no coating...so nothing can rust...as so many other reviewers here have confirmed. Neither the high speed metal brushed finish nor the mirror finish will affect its nonrust qualities...it is just a cosmetic thing.5) ITS FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION. Discipline and restraint, with utility in mind, results in the Frieling's handsome, elegant, and understated lines. Appearance has been given a slight nod. It's all business. Even its high polish is not there to WOW at, but to make it easier to clean. There are no false touches present; only the authentic remains. The entire achievement makes it presentable for casual entertaining, even for more formal occasions. A matching sugar and creamer, with spoon, is available. Its tall, slightly narrow profile has a small footprint, taking up little space on the counter or the table. Shopper's note: Confusing an insulated Press with an insulated carafe is a very common blunder. ANY brand of thermal insulated French Press is specifically designed as a brewer, NOT as a thermal carafe or thermos, so brewed coffee MUST be poured into cups IMMEDIATELY after the four minute brewing period or the continued steeping will produce, even if over a minute, an overextracted, bitter, and insipid cup! For leftover coffee, use a preheated thermal carafe or thermos, with a screwon sealed lid, specifically designed to store hot coffee, and to keep it hot, after it is brewed. Actually, it is best not to store coffee. Consume coffee within 1015 minutes for the best flavor. For more coffee simply brew more coffee for the best flavor.6) THE POT'S SMALL SPOUT is dripless due to its lipped design. Not a stray drop on the tablecloth yet after four years of daily use. The spout is small enough to lose minimal heat, and I tested the heat loss by plugging the spout with window pane putty and measured only a one degree F heat loss compared to an open spout when brewing. It therefore needs no mechanism to close the spout. You will discover that the spout is large enough for a quick, steepstopping pour.7) THE INSULATED LID is entirely unique. It is, with one exception, the only INSULATED lid for a French Press to be found by any manufacturer. Heat rises, and as far as heat is concerned, the pot functions as a chimney, focusing heat above, and its opening is where most heat is lost. This lid caps the heat with its tight fit and insulation. The lid's underside dome shape helps assist in that, like a domed teakettle. The overall lid design is critical if you care to brew at the proper 195205 degree F temperature. THIS WAS THE FINAL KICKER IN MY DECISION TO CHOOSE THE FRIELING, along with the other goodies.8) THE INSULATED HANDLE is crafted of hollow, extruded stainless, all of a piece, to keep it cool, as well as to keep it llight weight so as not to unsteady the pot. The handle's vertical upright is ovoid in crosssection to provide comfort for the gripping fingers. A secure niche for the thumb is provided with its horizontal thumb rest and thumbblock. An often overlooked feature in cup or French Press design, because if the thumb rests on on a horizontal support, especially if that support is provided with a means of blocking the thumb from slipping off, one's grip is then very secure indeed. Take a look at the photo of the handle on this site, you'll see it. The long, vertical provides plenty of clearance for the fingers, and is angled inward toward the bottom to secure the fingers, also to provide good leverage when pouring.9) THE PLUNGER, when pushed down, results in a dynamic turbulence that agitates the water and grounds to intensify flavors...this is the heart of the Press, and what makes French Press what it is. It also separates the grounds from the coffee, so it is fitted to precise specifications to minimize stray grounds coming through the filter or from between the pot's inner walls and the periphery of the plunger, and thence into the cup. The unit is entirely crafted from 18/10 stainless steel (the best grade)...no plastic parts to retain stale tastes whatsoever. Easy to dissemble for cleaning and spare parts are always available. Remember, with ANY French Press you will have stray grounds, especially if you buy canned coffee because it is always ground too fine for French Press, or if you use anything but a burr grinder. Even so, tiny grounds sneak in...French Pressists never sip that last sip: don't blame the Frieling Press, or a Bodum, or a BonJour.10) REPLACEMENT PARTS AND EXCHANGES FOR VALID PROBLEMS ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE. My online and telephone experience with Frieling USA has been excellent. They will replace any product or part you feel is defective. Also, down the line, parts such as the filter screen. cross plate, spiral plate of the plunger assembly, or the plunger rod, are available at very reasonable prices.11) FRIELING KEEPS GOOD COMPANY. Beside Amazon, the finest, most prestigious online coffee gear retailers carry it: cateringplanet, wholelattelove, seattlecoffeegear, clivecoffee, terroircoffee, williamssonoma, espressozone, shop. illy, chriscoffee, liquidplanet, roaste, crateandbarrel, coffee. become, coffeebydesign, coffeeart, veniacoffee, greentreecoffee, blacksmithcoffee, wayfair, etc.12) USEFUL FOR MAKING \"OPEN POT\" COFFEE. You can also use this for \"OPEN POT\" brewing, the simple, \"connoisseur's method,\" also called \"Cowboy Coffee.\" With this method, you simply dose a pot with coffee, pour in offboil water, and steep with the lid on, but with the plunger extended just, stir three times during the steep, after the four minute steep pour through a fine filter into your cup. The flavor is similar to French Pressed coffee.13) USEFUL AS AN INSULATED SERVING PITCHER FOR HOT OR COLD DRINKS. Use the Freiling for serving cold juices, milk, or ice water; use it for serving hot syrup, hot chocolate, hot milk, etc.14) EASY TO CLEAN. The Freiling is dishwasher safe and that will remove any water spots or fingerprints with ease. The plunger filter assembly does not need to be taken apart to clean. Handwashing is often used when camping. Coffee oils build up on grinders and coffee makers of any kind...same here. So, periodically, when you see a thin brown film, use a watervinegar solution and let soak overnight, then scrub well. CONS:1) THE LID CAN SLIP FORWARD A BIT WHEN POURING: The lid is snug for pressing, but while pouring, the lid can slip forward a half inch or so. Solutionthe \"teapot pour\", the way waitstaff use it: with the finger(s) of one hand, lightly press down on the lid, the other hand grips the handle to pour. Or, use the \"onehand pour\": grip the handle with your fingers, press down lightly with side of your thumb upon the flat of the lid's back edge, or use the index finger as another reviewer here mentioned, then pour...easy and secure. If you are extremely heatsensitive just use a potholder to hold to lid. I never need to, and neither do my Frieling French Press using friends, including my daughter.2) A FEW SMALL PARTICLES OF GRIND CAN CATCH IN THE PLUNGER, in the tiny screen seam. SolutionIf that happens, then after brewing and rinsing out your Frieling, fill with hot water, replace lid and plunger. Then, pumping vigorously up and down a few times, the turbulence removes the particles. I seldom have to do that twice or use a small brush. Then place the pot and plunger in the dishwasher.3) FRIELING'S SIZING IS CONFUSING CUSTOMERS: Capacities of Frieling's presses are often expressed in two capacities: he \"serving\" capacity and the \"maximum capacity\" when used as a serving carafe for liquids other than coffee. Very often the \"serving capacity\" is not accurate, serving less than the amount stated. Moreover, various vendors, Amazon sellers, and other retailers list the same model at different capacities. It is maddening. Not only that, but most customers do not know that the \"cups\" Frieling and all coffee manufacturers refer to are actually the European \"Tasse\" cup of 4.22 fluid oz each (1/8 liter, 125ml), NOT the US 8oz measuring cup, so customers often feel misinformed when coffee servings are HALF what they expected. Frieling is innocent of misrepresentation here: it is customer ignorance that is at fault. Regardless, Frieling needs to address this issue ASAP and give us the ACTUAL YIELD per serving, in US fluid ounces, of each size offered. CONCLUSIONThe Frieling French presses are a commercial, industrial design with commercialgrade stainless, insulated everywhere, including the lid, easier to clean than with plastic parts that also retain flavors. Holds the brew temperature at the correct SCAA recommended 195205 degrees, the most important brewing feature of all. Dishwasher hardy and cleanup is easy. Handsome and presentable for entertaining. Durable to the maximum. Excellent, all stainless plunger, few stray particles, produces minimal silt. Highly recommended. 4.8 Amazon stars.

LA CAFETIERE THERMIQUE 8c, $35, 4.2 stars: NO plastics, INSULATED LID, drips, MIXED REVIEWS, stable. P.S. Most of the above brands and models, Bodum and BonJour in particular, I respect for their overall quality, if not for the plastic parts. They, and Frieling, all make similar coffee, but with varying degrees of insulation efficiency and thus very noticeable flavorintensity outcomes. Being consumergrade products, they are not expected to be as durable as commercialgrade equivalents, such as Frieling, due to their intended work environment. Consequently, their comparison with the Frieling is a bit unfair...like comparing apples to oranges. Always buy commercial products whenever possible...the tough guys. By the way, if you remain loyal to glassbeakered Presses, the doubleglass wall, insulated version of the iconic Bodum Chambord 8c ($80) is available (being that glass holds in heat better than metal, I can recommend it), but a replacement beaker is $50, $130 total Amazon. If insulation is not important to you, the glass beakered, single walled, Bodum Eileen ($67 Amazon for the 8c), with its \"full metal perforated jacket\" of stainless, is widely used in French restaurants and bistros as a commercial Press; it is fairly durable for a single wall Press due to the metal sheath, but its single wall will NOT keep the brew at the right temperature. A REBUTTAL OF THE MOST COMMON CRITICAL REVIEWS, AND SOME OVER THE TOP ONESTHE COMMON ONES1) \"Some grounds and silt bypass the filter and are in my cup.\" Answer: some will always pass through, it is a French Press thing, common to all brands and models...French Pressists never take that last sip. But there are three ways to dramatically reduce that, 1) the fault, almost invariably, USING A WHIRLYBLADE GRINDER, or the LACK OF A CONICAL BURR GRINDER that allows you to grind EVENLY and COARSELY, no more dustandboulders; or b) not grinding COARSELY enough with any grinder; or c) buying CANNED OR PACKAGED PREGROUND coffee ground FINE for drip coffee so that fine grounds can bypass the French Press's filter. Grind mediumcourse for French Press, not\" fine. If you have no good grinder then have your coffee source grind it coarsely for you.2) \"My coffee does not stay hot very long after I pour it.\" Answer: ANY brand of French Press is designed to BREW coffee, and NOT TO STORE IT. Period. Stainless Steel, or glass, doublewalled Presses are designed to keep the brewing coffee at the correct temperature (195205 degrees) DURING THE BREW CYCLE and are NOT MEANT TO STORE COFFEE AFTER THE BREW CYCLE IS COMPLETED. If the steep goes much past 4 minutes you get nasty coffeeoverextracted and bitter. I am convinced that the confusion comes from mistaking what it looks like: an insulated pot \"looks\" like a thermos, or insulated carafe. Well, it's not. It's a brewer. Timing is critical when making any coffee. Espresso Baristas use a timer to cut short their pull at 2530 seconds per shot, with French Press (and drip) set your timer to 3.5 to 4.5 minutes per extraction (4 minutes is the sweet spot).3)\"I get this metallic taste (or bitter taste, or stale taste, take your pick).\" Stainless steel, especially foodgrade 18/10 stainless used in the Frieling, is famed for imparting ZERO taste to food or beverages. It's what it's known for. The offtastes come from other sources such as, a) coffeol oil and collagen residues adhering to the Press wall, or in your grinder, or both...keep them clean, or 2) certain coffees give off unusual flavor notes also, or c) your water might be less than ideal, or d) your dishwash detergent is not thoroughly rinsed off. It's NOT the metal itself. THE OVERTHETOP ONES\"The handle breaks off,\" or \"has a sloppy weld.\" Or, \"Cannot clean the thing at all.\" Or, \"I get gray powder on my paper towel when I wipe it out.\" Answer: These are over the top, spoiler, dealkilling statements and are intended to be so, for various malicious reasons, I remain convinced, and so utterly lacking in truth that they are laughable. The laserweld on the handle is so secure that the restaurant supply managers I personally know say they have never experienced any handle failures or sloppy welds, none, ever. Dirty Stainless is not 18/10 stainless's fault, so if really neglected use foodservice's favorite: Barkeeper's Friend, use it gently, rinse. Lastly...\"It shows fingerprints all the time, and spots\"...uh, well, wipe them off, how hard is that? Or sell it on ebay and buy the new matte brushedfinish Frieling. Gray powder on the inside? Not possible with 18/10 Stainless...has to be bad water or bad dishwashing detergent, come on, think of a better pot shot. Frieling's positive 4 & 5 star reviews are 94% of the total here. That is highly unusual on Amazon. So don't worry, the $75 is only about $10 more than the lesser Bodums you might be shopping. It is money well spent, lasting for many, many years. I cherish my Frieling, and so will you. THE COFFEE HOUSE FRENCH PRESS BREW METHOD: The Hows and Whys USE CLEAN, COLD WATER. Brewing with a French Press is simple and easy. You have to know how to do it and WHY you are doing it to extract the most flavor possible. Essentially, your water flavor must be good so you begin by using cold, filtered water. You fill your kettle with TWICE the water needed: half to prewarm your Press and the other half for brewing. USE THE RIGHT DOSE OF COFFEE BEANS. Dose coffee beans at 5565g of coffee beans per liter of water, or 70 grams if you \"break and clean\" (rather than stirring the bloom, you break the bloom foam cake and spoon out the surface grounds to reduce the fines, in which case you sacrifice some brewing grounds, so you need to overdose a bit).  Use a kitchen scale to measure. BEGIN GRINDING THE BEANS JUST BEFORE THE WATER BOILS. Once the bean husk is cracked open favor immediately escapes, so wait until the last minute to grind, just as the water begins to boil. BREW AT THE CORRECT TEMPERATURE.  As the water almost boils, start your grinder, prewarm your Press with half the offboil water, empty the Press and fill with the grounds weighed on a scale. Then pour in the other half of the water, using a scale to measure, at about 205208 degrees F so as the temperature drops during the brew you are NEVER brewing lower than 195 degrees F. NEVER begin at 195 degrees F or flavor really suffers as the temp at brew's end can even drop to 185 degrees F...not good! BREW FOR THE CORRECT TIME. A fourminute brew cycle is highly recommended. Anything less gives you a raw, underextracted cup, anything more gives you an overcooked, overextracted, bitter cup. At Brew's end, ALWAYS pour out coffee into cups to terminate the brewing. NEVER store coffee in any coffee brewer as it will continue to brew! Even with drip brewing coffee is stored in a carafe...do that same here. A coffee brewer of any kind is NOT a coffee storage carafe. That is a job for a thermally insulated carafe. The insulation in a French Press is there to keep the brew at the correct temperature DURING the brew cycle. BREWING IT: An upclose look at brewing French Press Coffee1. FILL KETTLE with at least TWICE the water needed to brew. Use only fresh, neverboiled, COLD, FILTERED water, not the nasty tasting, mildly rusty hot water sitting inside your hot water heater. Now begin heating your water at high heat.2. WEIGH YOUR BEANS. While the water heats, place your grinder's groundscollecting bin on your scales, then tare to zero. After weighing, pour the beans into the grinder's hopper, then place the grounds bin in the grinder to catch the grounds when you grind.3. GRIND YOUR BEANS. Set your grinder to a mid coarse setting, as coarse as coarsely ground pepper, and experiment to get the dosage just right for your taste...I like the finer side of coarse.  When your water almost boils, at about 210211 degrees F, turn off the heat and start your grinder and let the water temp drop a bit in the meantime.4. WEIGH WATER AS YOU POUR, THEN STEEP. While the grinder is grinding, pour hot water into your Press to warm it.  When the grinding is completed, pour the warming water from the Press into your cup(s) to prewarm them, discard remaining water from the Press. Then pour your coffee grounds to the Press and place your Press on your scales, tare the Press to zero. To monitor heat place a thermometer in your Press. Now pour in the kettle's remaining 205208 degree F water into the Press as shown on your scale (I use 870900g in my 1 liter Press). Place the lid on the Press with plunger extended upward to begin the brewing cycle. Set your timer to 4 minutes.5. STIR, SINK, OR SCOOP OFF THE BLOOM. After after one minute, either gently stir, or sink the bloom with a spoon, or remove (break) the cake \"crust\" with a soup spoon (or two) to gently scoop to remove (clean) the bloom off the top to reduce the amount of fines in the brew. Be sure no grounds remain above the plunger or in the spout as those grounds will end up in your cup.6. REPLACE THE LID AND FINISH BREWING. With the lid on, continue to brew until the timer beeps, then press the plunger down VERY SLOWLY to the bottom (to reduce agitation of any fines present). Pour out the warming water from your cup(s), THEN pour in the hot coffee from the Press to replace it. Serve and enjoy. This is the ambrosia people are talking about...properly made French Press. Hoping to cover all the bases, and to eliminate any confusion, I have gone into great detail so you know not only HOW to properly make French Press, but also WHY you make it that way. Making French Press is actually a very simple ritual once you do it a few times, much simpler than it appears in the above. NOTE: The French Press pictured above is the highly regarded doublewalled insulated Frieling Ultimo French Press made of 100% 18/10 stainless steel with a stainless steel lid and parts..no plastic parts in the lid or filter plunger. The Frieling is a fine hotel and restaurant grade product available in five sizes. Available in mirror polished or brushed matte finishes.

      "\"One chews coffee beans while gargling 200 F water for four minutes; pressing with the tongue, coffee is filtered through the teeth: is this the French press you refer to?\"  M. PythonAN INTRODUCTION TO COFFEE AMBROSIA. It's a quest for flavor. It's all about flavor. You are here searching for the best quality French Press, one that delivers the most flavorful coffee possible. You might be new to French Press and are rightly skeptical about the vulnerability and safety of a glass model. Or, you might be experienced, a Bodum or BonJour refugee exasperated by having to replace your second, or third, or even your seventh broken glass beaker. No cuts? Lucky you. Been there. Below: First is a look at buying a French Press, followed by a Review of the Frieling French Press, then info on grinders, accessories, buying coffee, and brewing the best French Press. SHOPPING FOR A FRENCH PRESS: WHAT TO LOOK FORFIRST, WHAT IS FRENCH PRESS? Call it French Press, Press Pot, Cafetiere, Plunger Pot, Pressed Coffee, Coffee Press, or Cafe a Piston, it is all the same. Invented by an Italian man, popularized in France, \"French Press\" has emigrated to North America. The apparatus itself is strikingly simple: A handled pot, a lid, and a plunger. A French Press can be made of glass, metal, plastic, or ceramic. The pot is never placed on a stove burner...hot water is poured over ground coffee and steeped a few minutes, the plunger is pressed down, the brewed coffee is then poured into cups. French Press is a handson brewing method that allows the user to control brewing variables, adjusting for personal taste. This is a fullimmersion brewing method where the bed of grounds can steep, or soak, for a few minutes prior to pressing to terminate the brewing, thereby remarkably intensifying the brew's flavors and aromas when properly brewed using proper equipment. Usually, coarsely ground coffee beans are poured into the Press followed by offtheboil water, allowed to steep about four minutes at the correct temperature, then the pistonlike, porous filter plunger is slowly pressed down to filter and separate the grounds from the brewed coffee just prior to serving. A simple ritual indeed. In order to brew French Press you need a French Press. So, for shrewd shopping, French Press design features are discussed below...SIMPLICITY. No unnecessary parts means less parts to fail or to clean. ROBUST CONSTRUCTION: Your pot,lid and plunger should be of sturdy, durable construction using rustfree metals such as foodgrade stainless steel, high impact, BPAfree plastics, borosilicate glass, or quality ceramics with foodsafe glazes. The most durable, heavyduty quality is heavyduty restaurant/hotel commercial grade rather than the far less durable, lightduty consumer grade. INSULATION: Coffee Science has confirmed that coffee should be brewed at between 195 and 205 degrees F during the ENTIRE brewing cycle to release as much flavor and aroma as possible. The brewing cycle is usually four minutes for French Press. To keep temperatures within this range during the brewing cycle requires an INSULATED French Press. French Press designs that will do so are: thermal doublewall stainless or glass, thickwall ceramic designs, or inexpensive \"thermos\" designs. A heads up: An INSULATED French Press is a dedicated coffee BREWER, and is NOT a coffee storage vessel designed to store coffee after brewing...therefore it should NOT be confused with an INSULATED \"thermos,\" a design dedicated only to STORING hot or cold beverages. So, after brewing, immediately pour ALL coffee into cups or into an insulated thermos. This will immediately terminate brewing to avoid overextraction, producing a bitter cup. DISHWASHER SAFE. Ensure that your Press is dishwasher safe, and is easy to clean if handwashed. Look for hidden corners or crevices. Insist on dishwasher safe highheat resistant materials. EFFECTIVE FILTER. Your plunger's filter screen, the metal mesh, must filter, or separate, coffee grounds from the brewed coffee. The finer the screen the better it does so, BUT, and I mean the BIG BUT...no matter how good your grinder is, or your filter, some very fine particles will always make it through the filter, ending up at the bottom of your cup. It cannot be helped. Why?Because if the screen is too fine, almost solid, all grounds might be filtered out, but then it might be impossible to push the plunger to the bottom because of the resistance encountered when coffee cannot pass through the filter, yet if the filter screen is too porous then the amount of \"fines\" coming through the filter screen will markedly increase. The solution?Aside from optimal filter porosity, a quality burr grinder is key in reducing to a minimum the amount of \"fines\" coming into your cup. Even still, do not take the last sip...a bit of silt in the cup is a French Press thing...part of its reality, part of its pleasure...the price you pay for excellence in the cup. COMFORTABLE, SECURE HANDLE. You need a comfortable, secure, insulated handle. Look for a handle with a horizontal grip for the thumb and clearance for the fingers. Your handle should stay cool, especially when pouring. Its grip design should be comfy and encourage a confident, accurate pour. STABLE POT. Your Press should be stable enough to resist accidental tipping when struck: A Press can have tall proportions IF the weight is substantial. A base smaller that the width at any point is not a good design. DRIPLESS SPOUT. Your French Press should never drip or dribble when pouring...return it if it does so. Good design prevents that. SAFE TO USE. Your Press must be safe to use when not fully awake in the morning. As you know, accidents and fumbles can happen, so avoid materials that might shatter, crack, or injure you, as well as needing replacement. Only foodgrade 18/5 or the better 18/10 stainless steel should be used. Glass beakers should be highheat resistant, Pyrex type borosilicate glass. If plastics are used, ensure that they are foodsafe, BPAfree, and are not porous enough to harbor bacteria (or harbor stale coffee tastes and aromas). If ceramics are used, ensure that the glazes are food safe, cadmium and cobaltfree, or FDA approved. MATCHING YOUR FRENCH PRESS SIZE TO YOUR DESIRED COFFEE SERVING SIZEBUY THE RIGHT SIZE FOR YOUR DESIRED SERVING SIZE : When brewing fill the press no higher than an inch or more from the brim, or to the V at the bottom of the spout. This reduces capacity, but prevents coffee ejecting from the spout when pressing down. Room MUST be allowed for the halfinch to oneinch thick CO2 caused foamy \"bloom\" to rise, the water displacement of the plunger and spillage room. Do not forget the volume of the grounds either, and the 24 ounces of water retained by the grounds after pouring. Because of the facts mentioned above, any \"tothebrim\" capacity claimed by the maker must be adjusted downward by at least 26 fl. oz., in proportion to the size of the press. This goes for ALL brands and models of French Press products. For example, Frieling's stated capacities are often confusing and not clearly defined, so you might need to contact Freiling to ask questions prior to purchase, or read the below. Do so when shopping Bodum, BonJour, Frieling, or any brand of French Press. To eliminate confusion, you need to know the actual, always lesser, YIELD of served coffee in fluid ounces, not the maximum capacity, to the brim, of the French Presses you are comparing. If in doubt, go larger. A REVIEW OF THE FRIELING FRENCH PRESSPROS:1) FRIELING OWNERS ON AMAZON VOTE IT AN AVERAGE OF 4.7 STARS, 94% POSITIVE. You might have noticed that few products on Amazon are rated that highly.2) FRIELING MAKES FIVE SIZES FOR YOUR DESIRED PORTION SIZE. Frieling's stated sizes are at full capacity, but it is prudent to reduce that maximum capacity by about 26 fluid ounces, depending upon the size chosen, to allow space for the plunger and the inevitable rising head of bloomfoam when hot water hits the ground coffee. Accordingly, Frieling makes FIVE sizes to suit your capacity needs: 8 fl/oz, 16 fl/oz, 23 fl/oz, 36 fl/oz, and 44 fl/oz.3) DOUBLEWALL THERMAL INSULATION. Frieling makes only one model, the Ultimo, in polished or brushed finish. ALL its three main elements are hollow, doublewall insulated: the pot, the handle, AND the lid. So far, it is the only brand or model of French Press, with one exception, to possesses ALL three featuresthe insulated LID in particular. Such insulation will keep your brewing coffee at 195205 degrees F during the entire brewing cycle resulting in maximum flavor and aroma, as verified by the Specialty Coffee Association of America. FrielingUSA states that such insulation retains heat four times longer than a glass French press.4) 18/10 STAINLESS, COMMERCIALGRADE DURABILITY. Unique to Frieling, this heavy duty French Press is made of food grade, foodsafe solid stainless steel, 18/10 (18% chromium, 10% nickel: best quality), heavy gauge stainless steel stock. This quality, special alloy is foodsafe and leadfree, meant for commercial use in hotel roomservice and hotel dining rooms, for finecuisine restaurants, for caterers, and is sold to specialty, highend hotel/restaurant supply houses (still Frieling's primary business). Such high quality steel NEVER rusts or stains, and I mean NEVER. Also, it will never shatter or injure you. Survives dishwasher hell, and comes out looking like new. The Frieling was once under the radar. It is now available to the public at better coffeeware or kitchenware stores, and is available here on Amazon, far from its industrial roots. The interior is brushed, and because the stainless walls are solid all the way through, the plunger cannot scratch off any \"coating\" because there is no coating...so nothing can rust...as so many other reviewers here have confirmed. Neither the high speed metal brushed finish nor the mirror finish will affect its nonrust qualities...it is just a cosmetic thing.5) ITS FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION. Discipline and restraint, with utility in mind, results in the Frieling's handsome, elegant, and understated lines. Appearance has been given a slight nod. It's all business. Even its high polish is not there to WOW at, but to make it easier to clean. There are no false touches present; only the authentic remains. The entire achievement makes it presentable for casual entertaining, even for more formal occasions. A matching sugar and creamer, with spoon, is available. Its tall, slightly narrow profile has a small footprint, taking up little space on the counter or the table. Shopper's note: Confusing an insulated Press with an insulated carafe is a very common blunder. ANY brand of thermal insulated French Press is specifically designed as a brewer, NOT as a thermal carafe or thermos, so brewed coffee MUST be poured into cups IMMEDIATELY after the four minute brewing period or the continued steeping will produce, even if over a minute, an overextracted, bitter, and insipid cup! For leftover coffee, use a preheated thermal carafe or thermos, with a screwon sealed lid, specifically designed to store hot coffee, and to keep it hot, after it is brewed. Actually, it is best not to store coffee. Consume coffee within 1015 minutes for the best flavor. For more coffee simply brew more coffee for the best flavor.6) THE POT'S SMALL SPOUT is dripless due to its lipped design. Not a stray drop on the tablecloth yet after four years of daily use. The spout is small enough to lose minimal heat, and I tested the heat loss by plugging the spout with window pane putty and measured only a one degree F heat loss compared to an open spout when brewing. It therefore needs no mechanism to close the spout. You will discover that the spout is large enough for a quick, steepstopping pour.7) THE INSULATED LID is entirely unique. It is, with one exception, the only INSULATED lid for a French Press to be found by any manufacturer. Heat rises, and as far as heat is concerned, the pot functions as a chimney, focusing heat above, and its opening is where most heat is lost. This lid caps the heat with its tight fit and insulation. The lid's underside dome shape helps assist in that, like a domed teakettle. The overall lid design is critical if you care to brew at the proper 195205 degree F temperature. THIS WAS THE FINAL KICKER IN MY DECISION TO CHOOSE THE FRIELING, along with the other goodies.8) THE INSULATED HANDLE is crafted of hollow, extruded stainless, all of a piece, to keep it cool, as well as to keep it llight weight so as not to unsteady the pot. The handle's vertical upright is ovoid in crosssection to provide comfort for the gripping fingers. A secure niche for the thumb is provided with its horizontal thumb rest and thumbblock. An often overlooked feature in cup or French Press design, because if the thumb rests on on a horizontal support, especially if that support is provided with a means of blocking the thumb from slipping off, one's grip is then very secure indeed. Take a look at the photo of the handle on this site, you'll see it. The long, vertical provides plenty of clearance for the fingers, and is angled inward toward the bottom to secure the fingers, also to provide good leverage when pouring.9) THE PLUNGER, when pushed down, results in a dynamic turbulence that agitates the water and grounds to intensify flavors...this is the heart of the Press, and what makes French Press what it is. It also separates the grounds from the coffee, so it is fitted to precise specifications to minimize stray grounds coming through the filter or from between the pot's inner walls and the periphery of the plunger, and thence into the cup. The unit is entirely crafted from 18/10 stainless steel (the best grade)...no plastic parts to retain stale tastes whatsoever. Easy to dissemble for cleaning and spare parts are always available. Remember, with ANY French Press you will have stray grounds, especially if you buy canned coffee because it is always ground too fine for French Press, or if you use anything but a burr grinder. Even so, tiny grounds sneak in...French Pressists never sip that last sip: don't blame the Frieling Press, or a Bodum, or a BonJour.10) REPLACEMENT PARTS AND EXCHANGES FOR VALID PROBLEMS ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE. My online and telephone experience with Frieling USA has been excellent. They will replace any product or part you feel is defective. Also, down the line, parts such as the filter screen. cross plate, spiral plate of the plunger assembly, or the plunger rod, are available at very reasonable prices.11) FRIELING KEEPS GOOD COMPANY. Beside Amazon, the finest, most prestigious online coffee gear retailers carry it: cateringplanet, wholelattelove, seattlecoffeegear, clivecoffee, terroircoffee, williamssonoma, espressozone, shop. illy, chriscoffee, liquidplanet, roaste, crateandbarrel, coffee. become, coffeebydesign, coffeeart, veniacoffee, greentreecoffee, blacksmithcoffee, wayfair, etc.12) USEFUL FOR MAKING \"OPEN POT\" COFFEE. You can also use this for \"OPEN POT\" brewing, the simple, \"connoisseur's method,\" also called \"Cowboy Coffee.\" With this method, you simply dose a pot with coffee, pour in offboil water, and steep with the lid on, but with the plunger extended just, stir three times during the steep, after the four minute steep pour through a fine filter into your cup. The flavor is similar to French Pressed coffee.13) USEFUL AS AN INSULATED SERVING PITCHER FOR HOT OR COLD DRINKS. Use the Freiling for serving cold juices, milk, or ice water; use it for serving hot syrup, hot chocolate, hot milk, etc.14) EASY TO CLEAN. The Freiling is dishwasher safe and that will remove any water spots or fingerprints with ease. The plunger filter assembly does not need to be taken apart to clean. Handwashing is often used when camping. Coffee oils build up on grinders and coffee makers of any kind...same here. So, periodically, when you see a thin brown film, use a watervinegar solution and let soak overnight, then scrub well. CONS:1) THE LID CAN SLIP FORWARD A BIT WHEN POURING: The lid is snug for pressing, but while pouring, the lid can slip forward a half inch or so. Solutionthe \"teapot pour\", the way waitstaff use it: with the finger(s) of one hand, lightly press down on the lid, the other hand grips the handle to pour. Or, use the \"onehand pour\": grip the handle with your fingers, press down lightly with side of your thumb upon the flat of the lid's back edge, or use the index finger as another reviewer here mentioned, then pour...easy and secure. If you are extremely heatsensitive just use a potholder to hold to lid. I never need to, and neither do my Frieling French Press using friends, including my daughter.2) A FEW SMALL PARTICLES OF GRIND CAN CATCH IN THE PLUNGER, in the tiny screen seam. SolutionIf that happens, then after brewing and rinsing out your Frieling, fill with hot water, replace lid and plunger. Then, pumping vigorously up and down a few times, the turbulence removes the particles. I seldom have to do that twice or use a small brush. Then place the pot and plunger in the dishwasher.3) FRIELING'S SIZING IS CONFUSING CUSTOMERS: Capacities of Frieling's presses are often expressed in two capacities: he \"serving\" capacity and the \"maximum capacity\" when used as a serving carafe for liquids other than coffee. Very often the \"serving capacity\" is not accurate, serving less than the amount stated. Moreover, various vendors, Amazon sellers, and other retailers list the same model at different capacities. It is maddening. Not only that, but most customers do not know that the \"cups\" Frieling and all coffee manufacturers refer to are actually the European \"Tasse\" cup of 4.22 fluid oz each (1/8 liter, 125ml), NOT the US 8oz measuring cup, so customers often feel misinformed when coffee servings are HALF what they expected. Frieling is innocent of misrepresentation here: it is customer ignorance that is at fault. Regardless, Frieling needs to address this issue ASAP and give us the ACTUAL YIELD per serving, in US fluid ounces, of each size offered. CONCLUSIONThe Frieling French presses are a commercial, industrial design with commercialgrade stainless, insulated everywhere, including the lid, easier to clean than with plastic parts that also retain flavors. Holds the brew temperature at the correct SCAA recommended 195205 degrees, the most important brewing feature of all. Dishwasher hardy and cleanup is easy. Handsome and presentable for entertaining. Durable to the maximum. Excellent, all stainless plunger, few stray particles, produces minimal silt. Highly recommended. 4.8 Amazon stars.

LA CAFETIERE THERMIQUE 8c, $35, 4.2 stars: NO plastics, INSULATED LID, drips, MIXED REVIEWS, stable. P.S. Most of the above brands and models, Bodum and BonJour in particular, I respect for their overall quality, if not for the plastic parts. They, and Frieling, all make similar coffee, but with varying degrees of insulation efficiency and thus very noticeable flavorintensity outcomes. Being consumergrade products, they are not expected to be as durable as commercialgrade equivalents, such as Frieling, due to their intended work environment. Consequently, their comparison with the Frieling is a bit unfair...like comparing apples to oranges. Always buy commercial products whenever possible...the tough guys. By the way, if you remain loyal to glassbeakered Presses, the doubleglass wall, insulated version of the iconic Bodum Chambord 8c ($80) is available (being that glass holds in heat better than metal, I can recommend it), but a replacement beaker is $50, $130 total Amazon. If insulation is not important to you, the glass beakered, single walled, Bodum Eileen ($67 Amazon for the 8c), with its \"full metal perforated jacket\" of stainless, is widely used in French restaurants and bistros as a commercial Press; it is fairly durable for a single wall Press due to the metal sheath, but its single wall will NOT keep the brew at the right temperature. A REBUTTAL OF THE MOST COMMON CRITICAL REVIEWS, AND SOME OVER THE TOP ONESTHE COMMON ONES1) \"Some grounds and silt bypass the filter and are in my cup.\" Answer: some will always pass through, it is a French Press thing, common to all brands and models...French Pressists never take that last sip. But there are three ways to dramatically reduce that, 1) the fault, almost invariably, USING A WHIRLYBLADE GRINDER, or the LACK OF A CONICAL BURR GRINDER that allows you to grind EVENLY and COARSELY, no more dustandboulders; or b) not grinding COARSELY enough with any grinder; or c) buying CANNED OR PACKAGED PREGROUND coffee ground FINE for drip coffee so that fine grounds can bypass the French Press's filter. Grind mediumcourse for French Press, not\" fine. If you have no good grinder then have your coffee source grind it coarsely for you.2) \"My coffee does not stay hot very long after I pour it.\" Answer: ANY brand of French Press is designed to BREW coffee, and NOT TO STORE IT. Period. Stainless Steel, or glass, doublewalled Presses are designed to keep the brewing coffee at the correct temperature (195205 degrees) DURING THE BREW CYCLE and are NOT MEANT TO STORE COFFEE AFTER THE BREW CYCLE IS COMPLETED. If the steep goes much past 4 minutes you get nasty coffeeoverextracted and bitter. I am convinced that the confusion comes from mistaking what it looks like: an insulated pot \"looks\" like a thermos, or insulated carafe. Well, it's not. It's a brewer. Timing is critical when making any coffee. Espresso Baristas use a timer to cut short their pull at 2530 seconds per shot, with French Press (and drip) set your timer to 3.5 to 4.5 minutes per extraction (4 minutes is the sweet spot).3)\"I get this metallic taste (or bitter taste, or stale taste, take your pick).\" Stainless steel, especially foodgrade 18/10 stainless used in the Frieling, is famed for imparting ZERO taste to food or beverages. It's what it's known for. The offtastes come from other sources such as, a) coffeol oil and collagen residues adhering to the Press wall, or in your grinder, or both...keep them clean, or 2) certain coffees give off unusual flavor notes also, or c) your water might be less than ideal, or d) your dishwash detergent is not thoroughly rinsed off. It's NOT the metal itself. THE OVERTHETOP ONES\"The handle breaks off,\" or \"has a sloppy weld.\" Or, \"Cannot clean the thing at all.\" Or, \"I get gray powder on my paper towel when I wipe it out.\" Answer: These are over the top, spoiler, dealkilling statements and are intended to be so, for various malicious reasons, I remain convinced, and so utterly lacking in truth that they are laughable. The laserweld on the handle is so secure that the restaurant supply managers I personally know say they have never experienced any handle failures or sloppy welds, none, ever. Dirty Stainless is not 18/10 stainless's fault, so if really neglected use foodservice's favorite: Barkeeper's Friend, use it gently, rinse. Lastly...\"It shows fingerprints all the time, and spots\"...uh, well, wipe them off, how hard is that? Or sell it on ebay and buy the new matte brushedfinish Frieling. Gray powder on the inside? Not possible with 18/10 Stainless...has to be bad water or bad dishwashing detergent, come on, think of a better pot shot. Frieling's positive 4 & 5 star reviews are 94% of the total here. That is highly unusual on Amazon. So don't worry, the $75 is only about $10 more than the lesser Bodums you might be shopping. It is money well spent, lasting for many, many years. I cherish my Frieling, and so will you. THE COFFEE HOUSE FRENCH PRESS BREW METHOD: The Hows and Whys USE CLEAN, COLD WATER. Brewing with a French Press is simple and easy. You have to know how to do it and WHY you are doing it to extract the most flavor possible. Essentially, your water flavor must be good so you begin by using cold, filtered water. You fill your kettle with TWICE the water needed: half to prewarm your Press and the other half for brewing. USE THE RIGHT DOSE OF COFFEE BEANS. Dose coffee beans at 5565g of coffee beans per liter of water, or 70 grams if you \"break and clean\" (rather than stirring the bloom, you break the bloom foam cake and spoon out the surface grounds to reduce the fines, in which case you sacrifice some brewing grounds, so you need to overdose a bit).  Use a kitchen scale to measure. BEGIN GRINDING THE BEANS JUST BEFORE THE WATER BOILS. Once the bean husk is cracked open favor immediately escapes, so wait until the last minute to grind, just as the water begins to boil. BREW AT THE CORRECT TEMPERATURE.  As the water almost boils, start your grinder, prewarm your Press with half the offboil water, empty the Press and fill with the grounds weighed on a scale. Then pour in the other half of the water, using a scale to measure, at about 205208 degrees F so as the temperature drops during the brew you are NEVER brewing lower than 195 degrees F. NEVER begin at 195 degrees F or flavor really suffers as the temp at brew's end can even drop to 185 degrees F...not good! BREW FOR THE CORRECT TIME. A fourminute brew cycle is highly recommended. Anything less gives you a raw, underextracted cup, anything more gives you an overcooked, overextracted, bitter cup. At Brew's end, ALWAYS pour out coffee into cups to terminate the brewing. NEVER store coffee in any coffee brewer as it will continue to brew! Even with drip brewing coffee is stored in a carafe...do that same here. A coffee brewer of any kind is NOT a coffee storage carafe. That is a job for a thermally insulated carafe. The insulation in a French Press is there to keep the brew at the correct temperature DURING the brew cycle. BREWING IT: An upclose look at brewing French Press Coffee1. FILL KETTLE with at least TWICE the water needed to brew. Use only fresh, neverboiled, COLD, FILTERED water, not the nasty tasting, mildly rusty hot water sitting inside your hot water heater. Now begin heating your water at high heat.2. WEIGH YOUR BEANS. While the water heats, place your grinder's groundscollecting bin on your scales, then tare to zero. After weighing, pour the beans into the grinder's hopper, then place the grounds bin in the grinder to catch the grounds when you grind.3. GRIND YOUR BEANS. Set your grinder to a mid coarse setting, as coarse as coarsely ground pepper, and experiment to get the dosage just right for your taste...I like the finer side of coarse.  When your water almost boils, at about 210211 degrees F, turn off the heat and start your grinder and let the water temp drop a bit in the meantime.4. WEIGH WATER AS YOU POUR, THEN STEEP. While the grinder is grinding, pour hot water into your Press to warm it.  When the grinding is completed, pour the warming water from the Press into your cup(s) to prewarm them, discard remaining water from the Press. Then pour your coffee grounds to the Press and place your Press on your scales, tare the Press to zero. To monitor heat place a thermometer in your Press. Now pour in the kettle's remaining 205208 degree F water into the Press as shown on your scale (I use 870900g in my 1 liter Press). Place the lid on the Press with plunger extended upward to begin the brewing cycle. Set your timer to 4 minutes.5. STIR, SINK, OR SCOOP OFF THE BLOOM. After after one minute, either gently stir, or sink the bloom with a spoon, or remove (break) the cake \"crust\" with a soup spoon (or two) to gently scoop to remove (clean) the bloom off the top to reduce the amount of fines in the brew. Be sure no grounds remain above the plunger or in the spout as those grounds will end up in your cup.6. REPLACE THE LID AND FINISH BREWING. With the lid on, continue to brew until the timer beeps, then press the plunger down VERY SLOWLY to the bottom (to reduce agitation of any fines present). Pour out the warming water from your cup(s), THEN pour in the hot coffee from the Press to replace it. Serve and enjoy. This is the ambrosia people are talking about...properly made French Press. Hoping to cover all the bases, and to eliminate any confusion, I have gone into great detail so you know not only HOW to properly make French Press, but also WHY you make it that way. Making French Press is actually a very simple ritual once you do it a few times, much simpler than it appears in the above. NOTE: The French Press pictured above is the highly regarded doublewalled insulated Frieling Ultimo French Press made of 100% 18/10 stainless steel with a stainless steel lid and parts..no plastic parts in the lid or filter plunger. The Frieling is a fine hotel and restaurant grade product available in five sizes. Available in mirror polished or brushed matte finishes.

      "Should you get an adjustable bed?  Absolutely.  Being able to adjust your bed is a life changer, plain and simple.  Whether you are old and decrepit or young and active, you will relax more easily and sleep better than you ever have in your life.  If you can at all afford an adjustable bed, GET ONE.  The only question is how much to spend.  If the Prodigy is totally out of your price range, don't despair.  Most adjustable beds are surprisingly reliable (my mom has had one for over 20 years with no problems), and from what I've read, most people are extremely happy with whatever model they get. My husband and I thought about getting Leggett & Platt's SCape model, which we found for about $400 less than the best price we found on a Prodigy (in a split king), but we talked ourselves into getting the Prodigy for many reasons. WEIGHT CAPACITY AND SOUNDThe SCape can be purchased with either a quieter DC motor with a 450pound weight limit (per side) or an AC motor, which is a lot noisier, but can handle 600 pounds.  However, the Prodigy has a different type of motor, so it is supposed to have the best of both worlds: They claim that it is the quietest motor made, but it has a 600pound capacity.  In the store, we could barely hear the motor.  At home, we found it to be a lot louder than we remembered.  This made me glad that we got the allegedly quietest motor.  How loud is it?  If your partner is soundly asleep, it probably won't wake him/her up, especially if you have some white noise (like a fan) going in the background.  But if he/she is just starting to drift off and the room is otherwise very quiet, it might be startling.  My husband and I are up and down all night, but I don't recall (yet) being woken up by the motor on his side.  And he says he only notices I'm adjusting my side if he's already awake and sees the bed moving. Neither of us weigh anywhere near the weight capacity of the DC motor, so why should that matter?  I was concerned about maxing out the 450pound limit if we were both on the same side at the same time.  Also, a motor that typically lifts far less than its maximum capacity will tend to last longer.  And, as it turns out, a 600pound capacity isn't really a 600pound capacity (more about that later in this review under \"MOTORS\").REMOTE AND EXTRA FEATURESLED DisplayThe Prodigy is the only adjustable bed I have seen that has a display on the remote.  It has a clock (not as useful as you'd think; more on this later), and it shows you what level you are at (both for elevation and intensity of massage).  Why does this matter?  With other remotes, I found it frustrating to think, \"Is this the max massage?  Or one more click . . . ?  No, that's back to low\" (many other remotes have a single button that you push repeatedly to cycle through three different intensity levels).  This happened to me over and over again.  With the Prodigy, when the window says 100, I know I'm at full power.  I also liked that I could see what incline I was at.  This made it easy for my husband to precisely match his side to mine.  No eyeballing it.  I just said, \"Hey, meet me at 47!\"In practice, now that we actually own the beds, we have never used this feature for matching each other a single time.  We don't really pay attention to where each other is at.  Even with the beds at different heights, it's easy to roll over the \"cliff\" to snuggle up on the other side.  However, I still like having the display to know where I'm at in elevation and to make sure I have the massager turned up all the way. Memory ButtonsThe Prodigy has four userprogrammable memory buttons (no presets except \"flat\"), whereas the SCape has only one.  When you program one of the buttons, it remembers the elevation of the head, the foot, and whatever massage function you had going at the time (if any).  I have found that having my \"sweet spots\" programmed is invaluable, and the longer I have the bed, the more I value this feature.  However, your preferences will change from one day to the next, so you might tweak your inclines each time you use one of the memory buttons, anyway.  So if you need to get a lessexpensive bed that does not have the customizable memory buttons, don't despair.  Most remotes have a few presets, such as \"reading\" and \"zerogravity\" (legs up quite a bit and head elevated moderately; it's supposed to be the most soothing for your back; note that the Prodigy does NOT have a zeroG preset).Sleep Button and TimerThe first memory button is your sleep position.  It comes preset to \"flat,\" but you can change it to whatever position you prefer to sleep in.  The remote uses the settings of this button for two other sleeprelated features: the sleep timer and the snore function (and if you don't use either of those, you can treat this button the same as any of the other three memory buttons).  You can set a timer to return you after 30 or 60 minutes to your designated sleep position from whatever position you are currently in.  Prodigy is the only bed I know of with this feature.  This could be particularly useful if you often fall asleep reading or watching TV (set this at the same time you set the sleep timer on your TV!).I use the sleep timer for the opposite purpose: to sit me up so I don't unintentionally lie flat for too long.  Most of the time I sleep with both the head and the foot of the bed elevated somewhat.  By sleeping this way, I have completely eliminated morning backaches, and my migraine headaches have been reduced by probably 8090% (I have read that sleeping flat causes elevated intracranial pressure, which, in some people, can make them more susceptible to migraines).  Sometimes I still like to stretch out and lie flat.  But I found that if I sleep flat for too long, I wake up with my lower back hurting (as it used to, before I got my Prodigy) and with a stuffy head.  So now when I want to sleep flat for a while, I set the timer so I will be returned to my programmed sleeping position (with my head and feet elevated) after 60 minutes.  It wakes me up when the bed starts moving, but I just roll over onto my back and quickly fall back asleep.  No more waking up with a backache!Snore FunctionThe snore function is not terribly useful in a split bed.  The IDEA is good:  Your partner starts snoring, so you just press the snore button, which will raise your partner up a bit so he quits snoring (the default is 7 degrees, but you can change that to whatever you want).  After 30 minutes, it will return him to his specified \"sleep\" position.  The problem is that you can't activate this feature using YOUR remote (unless you have a nonsplit bed, which I don't recommend for a couple.  You know how it drives you crazy when your partner hogs the remote control to the TV?  The remote control to the BED is a LOT bigger of a deal.  When trying out a nonsplit bed in a store, my husband made me positively SEASICK with the remote.  Seriously, don't even consider getting a nonsplit adjustable bed).  My husband and I keep our own remotes and we use them repeatedly throughout the night, so exchanging remotes is not possible, and activating this function on the other remote would not be easy to accomplish. If you don't plan to use the snore function you can just store another favorite position there, but be aware that it will start moving you into your sleep position after 30 minutes.  You can avoid this by simply pushing the snore button again after the bed reaches the stored position (the first time puts you in whatever position you have stored there, and then pushing it again turns off the snore function, leaving you in that position; but don't push the remote the second time until you've reached the stored position, because pushing it the second time will stop the bed from moving).Clock and AlarmThe Prodigy has a clock built into the remote, which I thought was a great idea at first, but it's not well designed.  Having the display to show the time continuously (without backlighting) would have used minimal battery power, so I don't know why they didn't design it that way.  Unless you are currently using the remote, the screen is blank.  And, astoundingly, there is not a dedicated clock button.  You can push the \"Time Set\" button, which will take you directly to the clock, but be careful not to change the time accidentally.  (You can also force the display of the clock by pushing any other button, then waiting for the display to change briefly to the clock.)Speaking of that, the fact that you activate \"Time Set\" by just pushing one button, however briefly, is just asking for trouble.  I can see accidentally changing the time while fumbling with the remote in the middle of the night.  Even worse, the \"Alarm Set\" button is the same.  These functions should have had sliders. You can choose to have the bed wake you up at a set time by vibrating the bed, beeping the remote, or both.  The beeping sounds like a standard alarm clock, with a repeating series of five beeps.  I guess I can't really complain about that, but I think they really missed an opportunity to do something special with the alarm (such as being able to choose from a few different sounds, as you can on most cell phones).The vibration alarm function isn't bad.  It definitely wakes you up.  It's not too unpleasant of a way to wake up (unless you live in an earthquake zone; then it might make your heart pound for a few minutes), but, again, I think L&P; kind of missed an opportunity here.  Rather than have the vibration instantly go to full throttle, it would have been nice if it had started out very subtle and gradually increased in intensity.  Also, the beeping and vibration start at roughly the same time (with the beeping starting just slightly before the vibration).  It would have been nice if the audible alarm started a bit later to give you a chance to wake up by the vibration alone before having the audible alarm as a backup. You can snooze the alarms for five minutes by pushing any button, but to turn the alarms completely off, you have to push the \"Alarm Set\" button repeatedly until the alarm icons are cleared from the display on the remote.  Considering that the icons are one or two millimeters in size, good luck turning off that alarm when your eyes are bleary from sleep. The Prodigy is the only adjustable bed I know of with the alarm function, and that's one reason I wanted the Prodigy.  I thought using the vibration alone as an alarm would be a good way to wake up without waking up my husband.  But the vibration is very strong, so even though it only activates on my side, it wakes him up, too.  Despite the shortcomings of the alarm, I've found myself using it a lot. Remote Control LocatorThe remote control locator function is largely useless.  L&P; even ships their beds with this feature turned off.  Why?  Because it EATS batteries and they know that customers will quickly become dissatisfied with a batteryeating remote.  The problem is that once the feature is turned on, the remote has to \"listen\" for the base unit calling to it, and this uses a lot of power.  And you can't turn the function on AFTER you've lost the remote because it can only be done WITH the remote.  Additionally, even once you \"call\" a lost remote (you have to push a button on the power box under the bed . . . an awkward and dusty proposition, I'm sure), it can take at least one minute (possibly longer, I've heard) for the remote to start beeping (this is probably because the remote only \"listens\" intermittently to somewhat reduce power consumption).So, for example, my husband lost his remote in our covers this morning.  We dug and dug for it.  It would have been nice if we could have \"called\" it like a lost cell phone.  But even if we'd activated the feature (we hadn't), by the time we got out of our warm bed, crawled underneath, fumbled around for the control box, found the button, pushed the button, and waited a minute (or more) for the remote to beep, we'd have found it (it was under him).  The only time I can think that this feature would be useful is for an elderly person who is prone to leaving things in odd places (even then, a caregiver would probably have to come push the locator button).The Blue MenaceThe buttons on the remote are backlit with a blinding blue light that is activated when you push any button.  It's so bright, you could almost read by it.  This seems kind of cool until all you want to do is to \"go flat\" in the middle of the night, and as you fumble for the button, it's like having police lights in your rearview mirror.  I quickly learned to find the buttons I want by feel, and I hold the remote under the covers as I push them.  This, of course, completely negates the whole purpose of having the buttons backlit, but there you go.  Poor design.  A better idea would have been to have a much dimmer backlight that could be deactivated. The display window lights up in a stillbright, but slightly less rousing, orange.  I wish there was a way to disable the backlighting entirely, but there is not.  (I've uploaded a picture of the remote.)Remote ResponseRather than being infrared like most remotes are, the Prodigy remote is wifi.  This means that you don't have to point the remote at the control box under the bed to ensure a good transmission.  This might be an overhyped and unnecessary feature, but, in my experience, it was indeed the most responsive remote I tried.  I didn't particularly aim ANY of the remotes, and they generally worked, but not always.  I've yet to have the Prodigy miss a command.  In fact, I found that it actually worked from about 50 feet away and through a wall while facing away.  This might bring up the concern that if your neighbors have a Prodigy, too, you might accidentally (hehheh) adjust each other's beds.  But you don't need to worry about that.  Each remote is shipped already paired to the control box it's shipped with.  Remotes can be repaired to different control boxes, but you have to have physical access to both the remote and the control box to do so. Oddly, I often get an error code on the remote which translates to meaning that the remote has lost contact with the control box.  Yet even when I get this message, the bed still does what I just told it to do.  There is some kind of glitch here.  Since my husband's bed does it, too, clearly the problem is not uncommon.  This is another one of those minor issues that make the Prodigy feel a bit like a beta test. Battery LifeThe batteries in my husband's remote gave out after five months.  Mine are still going, which is surprising, because I use my remote a lot more than he does his.  I guess five months isn't terrible (but keep in mind that each remote takes FOUR batteries), but without that awful lighting, they'd last a whole lot longer. WALLHUGGERNot all beds have the \"wallhugger\" feature.  As you raise the head, the entire bed slides backwards so that you don't end up so far away from where you started.  This is a great idea in theory.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work as well as you might hope.  There has to be room for your mattress and the base to clear the wall (or headboard), so that alone puts you well over a foot forward from the wall.  And the bed bends much farther down the mattress than you would have pillows propped.  So even with the wallhugger sliding you back as far as it can, your nightstand is still going to be WAY behind you.  We still haven't entirely figured out what to do about this problem.  Move the nightstands out away from the wall?  Get bigger nightstands?  Put them at the side of the beds, rather than at the head?  Whatever the solution, as big as this problem is, I can't imagine how much worse it would be in a bed that doesn't have this feature.  So even though it doesn't entirely solve the issue, it's a feature worth looking for. MASSAGEFor me, the massage feature was one of the biggest selling points for getting an adjustable bed.  I have a very good massage mat somewhere, but I have to get it out, position it, plug it in, then put it away, so I don't often use it.  How convenient to have the feature built into my bed!  However, oddly enough, I found that most men, including my husband, hate the massage feature.  Male sales associates shuddered with revulsion when talking about it and said something along the lines of, \"I'd never use it, but here's the massage button.\"  My husband hates it so much that I don't use the massage if he's in bed because it vibrates his side, too. I wish the massage were actually a bit stronger (it's not as intense as my massage mat), but it's powerful enough that one time when I was in another room and my daughter got into my bed, I could tell, through a closed door, when she turned on the massage.  So I'm guessing that if you have shared walls or floors with neighbors, they will hate you. Most L&P; beds have the \"wave\" function for the massage, so this isn't exclusive to Prodigy, but it's worth mentioning in case you are considering a different brand.  What the wave function does is turn the intensity of the vibration up and down (at an adjustable speed), alternating between the head and foot (if you have both turned on) so you kind of have the sensation of movement back and forth.  I find this MUCH better than just a steady, even vibration.  I think it would be less likely to cause the \"itchy\" feel that some people get from the vibration because it's not constantly at the same level.  When I tried beds without this feature, I still enjoyed the massage function, but I missed the wave.  This is a BIG deal to me, and this tiny subfeature alone made me narrow our choices down to just Leggett & Platt. However, something I don't like about the massage function on the Prodigy is that there is not a simple on/off button.  Unless you have it programmed into one of your memory buttons (which remember not only position, but massage level), you have to turn on the head and foot separately.  They start out at a default of 47% strength, and then you have to adjust each up and down separately.  If you want to turn massage off completely, you have to hold the \"down\" button until each reaches 0%.  This is annoying and timeconsuming.  I really wish I could just push one button that would return me to my last massage setting, or, once the massagers are on, turn them completely off. To get around this flaw, you can push one of the memory buttons (as long as you don't have massage programmed into it) or the \"flat\" button very quickly.  This will stop the massagers.  Unfortunately, if you are not quick enough on the button, it will start moving you to the position of the button you pushed (but you can stop the movement by quickly pushing the button again).The biggest disappointment about the massage feature (and this is probably common to all brands) is that you can't use it constantly.  I had visions of working all day on my laptop in bed with the massager turning my back to jelly.  But buried in the owners' manual (okay, it's on the first page, but it's still buried in stuff most people wouldn't read very carefully), you are cautioned to not use the massage function for more than two hours out of every six hours.  Does this mean that I can run it for two hours at a time as long as I cool it down for four hours afterwards?  Or does it mean that when it shuts off automatically after 30 minutes, I should always wait at least an hour before using it again?  (I've adopted the latter policy.)MOTORSOn the same warning page, you are also warned to not use the lift motors for more than four minutes out of forty minutes (\"10% duty cycle\").  Just lowering the headboard from fully upright takes about 30 seconds, so this sounds extremely restrictive, but most of the time you will not be making such extreme adjustments of position.  I often make little tweaks up and down, but that's just a second or two at a time on the motors.  Even when I go flat, I'm never starting from completely upright (the most upright position is REALLY, uncomfortably upright), so I guess I'm usually staying well within the \"duty cycle\" recommendations. A more concerning limitation, however, is this: \"The recommended weight restriction for Prodigy bases is 600 lb. The base will structurally support the recommended weight distributed evenly across the head and foot sections. This product is not designed to support or lift this amount in the head or foot sections alone.  . . . For best performance, consumers should enter and exit the adjustable base with the base in the flat position. DO NOT SIT ON THE HEAD OR FOOT SECTIONS WHILE IN THE RAISED POSITION.\"Okay, I don't know about you, but that eliminates a LOT of activities I had planned for this thing. Even aside from that, isn't part of the appeal of an adjustable bed to make it easier to get out of bed (with the head raised)?  And if my daughter comes in and wants to sit at the foot of the bed for a little chat, do I really have to lower it first?  These unexpected restrictions (which I'm sure are standard for all adjustable beds) make me extra glad we sprang for the highercapacity Prodigy.  Because, let me tell you, we will largely ignore these liftmotor restrictions.  If I had to return my bed to flat every time I got up, I would quickly use up my four minutes!APPLE INTEGRATIONIronically, Leggett and Platt's proudest feature on the Prodigy, the wifi Apple integration, is really something of a sham.  I think they added the option just to make the Prodigy sound unique and very hightech.  \"Control your bed with your phone!\"  However, you have to buy a separate wifi bridge for about $300 to allow your iPod or iPad to \"talk\" to the Prodigy.  Then all it does is act as a remote control (with no additional features, as far as I can tell, and without even a very elegant interface).  If ditching the included remote control and using your Apple device as a $300 remote is very important to you, then sure, consider this as a good feature.  But, oddly enough, there is not an Android app, so if you're not an Apple person, using this \"feature\" isn't even an option. PRODUCT DELIVERY AND ASSEMBLYIf you buy your bed from an authorized dealer, it will be shipped directly from Leggett & Platt.  Ours came from California and took nine days (to Colorado).  As we were warned, these things are unbelievably heavy and unwieldy.  We got a split king, which is really just two twin XL's.  Each one weighs 150 pounds, and the box is slightly larger than the size of a twin XL bed.  There is no disassembling to make it smaller, lighter, or in any way more manageable to carry and maneuver.  Unless you have arranged otherwise, the freight company will drop your bed(s) at your curb, and YOU are responsible for hauling them inside.  I was pretty much useless in helping with this (I could barely even lift my side of the box), so it's good that I have a strong husband.  If you don't, keep this in mind and arrange to have help. Assembly itself was unexpectedly simple.  Just screw in the legs, turn it over (ooph!), plug it in, and you're ready to go.  Okay, there are just a few other details.  There is a box into which you should install two 9V batteries as backup for being able to return the bed to \"flat\" during a power outage (note that each set of batteries is good for doing this only once, so don't unplug the bed and try it just for fun).  This was easy to do, and the batteries were included (Energizers!  Nice touch!).  You will also need to install four AAA batteries into the remote (also included, and also Energizers!).My husband felt that the way the power cables dangled down was just asking for trouble, so he looped them over the nonmoving crosspiece.  This could have been better engineered, but it's not a huge deal.  Just take a look at where the cables are once you've flipped the bed, and watch where they are as you raise and lower both ends. CONSTRUCTIONThis seems to be a wellmade bed.  Every component feels solid and durable.  This impression was backed up when we discovered that even extremely vigorous activities do not make the bed rock, creak, or bang against the wall.  This is one HUGE advantage of the bed being so heavy and being shipped fully assembled in one piece.  There are no joints in the frame to flex, no wooden slats to rub and squeak.  Combining the stability of the bed with its adjustability, we have discovered positions that were not previously practical, comfortable, or sustainable.  Add the firmness and nonbounciness of a memory foam mattress, and it is not an overstatement to declare that \"this changes everything.\"  In the past, I think adjustable beds were marketed primarily to older people, and they still have the association of being a \"hospital bed\" to stigmatize them, so that's probably why this aspect is not played up in the marketing.  But as far as I'm concerned, it's a legitimate reason, all by itself, to get this bed. As an added bonus, the solidness of the bed also means that we both get a better night's sleep because we almost never wake each other up anymore; turning over, or even getting in and out of bed, is totally silent. The base is thickly padded along the sides and covered with a suedelike fabric that is very pleasant to the touch.  The top of the base is covered with a somewhat rough fabric that will help keep your mattress in place. The mattressretaining bracket at the end of the bed does a fine job of keeping the bed from sliding down, but I wish the base had a similar bracket at the side.  I quickly discovered that raising and lowering the head makes the mattresses scoot off a bit at the top.  It's not a huge deal, even though it causes a gap between our mattresses, but a little side bracket near the top would have been so nice. BOTTOM LINEThe Prodigy is not a flawless product, so I had to give it less than five stars.  However, how much do I enjoy it?  IMMENSELY.  I have no regrets in getting an adjustable bed, and not even in choosing the moreexpensive Prodigy, despite its flaws.  My backaches have been virtually eliminated (although, granted, at least some of the credit for this probably goes to my new mattress), I sleep MUCH better, and I wake up without any stiffness.  When was the last time you were able to bound out of bed in the morning?  I feel 15 years younger.  Converting from a flat queen to a split king adjustable was a VERY expensive proposition, but I'm so glad we did it.  My only regret is in not getting one YEARS ago.\n",

      "\"One chews coffee beans while gargling 200 F water for four minutes; pressing with the tongue, coffee is filtered through the teeth: is this the French press you refer to?\"  M. PythonAN INTRODUCTION TO COFFEE AMBROSIA. It's a quest for flavor. It's all about flavor. You are here searching for the best quality French Press, one that delivers the most flavorful coffee possible. You might be new to French Press and are rightly skeptical about the vulnerability and safety of a glass model. Or, you might be experienced, a Bodum or BonJour refugee exasperated by having to replace your second, or third, or even your seventh broken glass beaker. No cuts? Lucky you. Been there. Below: First is a look at buying a French Press, followed by a Review of the Frieling French Press, then info on grinders, accessories, buying coffee, and brewing the best French Press. SHOPPING FOR A FRENCH PRESS: WHAT TO LOOK FORFIRST, WHAT IS FRENCH PRESS? Call it French Press, Press Pot, Cafetiere, Plunger Pot, Pressed Coffee, Coffee Press, or Cafe a Piston, it is all the same. Invented by an Italian man, popularized in France, \"French Press\" has emigrated to North America. The apparatus itself is strikingly simple: A handled pot, a lid, and a plunger. A French Press can be made of glass, metal, plastic, or ceramic. The pot is never placed on a stove burner...hot water is poured over ground coffee and steeped a few minutes, the plunger is pressed down, the brewed coffee is then poured into cups. French Press is a handson brewing method that allows the user to control brewing variables, adjusting for personal taste. This is a fullimmersion brewing method where the bed of grounds can steep, or soak, for a few minutes prior to pressing to terminate the brewing, thereby remarkably intensifying the brew's flavors and aromas when properly brewed using proper equipment. Usually, coarsely ground coffee beans are poured into the Press followed by offtheboil water, allowed to steep about four minutes at the correct temperature, then the pistonlike, porous filter plunger is slowly pressed down to filter and separate the grounds from the brewed coffee just prior to serving. A simple ritual indeed. In order to brew French Press you need a French Press. So, for shrewd shopping, French Press design features are discussed below...SIMPLICITY. No unnecessary parts means less parts to fail or to clean. ROBUST CONSTRUCTION: Your pot,lid and plunger should be of sturdy, durable construction using rustfree metals such as foodgrade stainless steel, high impact, BPAfree plastics, borosilicate glass, or quality ceramics with foodsafe glazes. The most durable, heavyduty quality is heavyduty restaurant/hotel commercial grade rather than the far less durable, lightduty consumer grade. INSULATION: Coffee Science has confirmed that coffee should be brewed at between 195 and 205 degrees F during the ENTIRE brewing cycle to release as much flavor and aroma as possible. The brewing cycle is usually four minutes for French Press. To keep temperatures within this range during the brewing cycle requires an INSULATED French Press. French Press designs that will do so are: thermal doublewall stainless or glass, thickwall ceramic designs, or inexpensive \"thermos\" designs. A heads up: An INSULATED French Press is a dedicated coffee BREWER, and is NOT a coffee storage vessel designed to store coffee after brewing...therefore it should NOT be confused with an INSULATED \"thermos,\" a design dedicated only to STORING hot or cold beverages. So, after brewing, immediately pour ALL coffee into cups or into an insulated thermos. This will immediately terminate brewing to avoid overextraction, producing a bitter cup. DISHWASHER SAFE. Ensure that your Press is dishwasher safe, and is easy to clean if handwashed. Look for hidden corners or crevices. Insist on dishwasher safe highheat resistant materials. EFFECTIVE FILTER. Your plunger's filter screen, the metal mesh, must filter, or separate, coffee grounds from the brewed coffee. The finer the screen the better it does so, BUT, and I mean the BIG BUT...no matter how good your grinder is, or your filter, some very fine particles will always make it through the filter, ending up at the bottom of your cup. It cannot be helped. Why?Because if the screen is too fine, almost solid, all grounds might be filtered out, but then it might be impossible to push the plunger to the bottom because of the resistance encountered when coffee cannot pass through the filter, yet if the filter screen is too porous then the amount of \"fines\" coming through the filter screen will markedly increase. The solution?Aside from optimal filter porosity, a quality burr grinder is key in reducing to a minimum the amount of \"fines\" coming into your cup. Even still, do not take the last sip...a bit of silt in the cup is a French Press thing...part of its reality, part of its pleasure...the price you pay for excellence in the cup. COMFORTABLE, SECURE HANDLE. You need a comfortable, secure, insulated handle. Look for a handle with a horizontal grip for the thumb and clearance for the fingers. Your handle should stay cool, especially when pouring. Its grip design should be comfy and encourage a confident, accurate pour. STABLE POT. Your Press should be stable enough to resist accidental tipping when struck: A Press can have tall proportions IF the weight is substantial. A base smaller that the width at any point is not a good design. DRIPLESS SPOUT. Your French Press should never drip or dribble when pouring...return it if it does so. Good design prevents that. SAFE TO USE. Your Press must be safe to use when not fully awake in the morning. As you know, accidents and fumbles can happen, so avoid materials that might shatter, crack, or injure you, as well as needing replacement. Only foodgrade 18/5 or the better 18/10 stainless steel should be used. Glass beakers should be highheat resistant, Pyrex type borosilicate glass. If plastics are used, ensure that they are foodsafe, BPAfree, and are not porous enough to harbor bacteria (or harbor stale coffee tastes and aromas). If ceramics are used, ensure that the glazes are food safe, cadmium and cobaltfree, or FDA approved. MATCHING YOUR FRENCH PRESS SIZE TO YOUR DESIRED COFFEE SERVING SIZEBUY THE RIGHT SIZE FOR YOUR DESIRED SERVING SIZE : When brewing fill the press no higher than an inch or more from the brim, or to the V at the bottom of the spout. This reduces capacity, but prevents coffee ejecting from the spout when pressing down. Room MUST be allowed for the halfinch to oneinch thick CO2 caused foamy \"bloom\" to rise, the water displacement of the plunger and spillage room. Do not forget the volume of the grounds either, and the 24 ounces of water retained by the grounds after pouring. Because of the facts mentioned above, any \"tothebrim\" capacity claimed by the maker must be adjusted downward by at least 26 fl. oz., in proportion to the size of the press. This goes for ALL brands and models of French Press products. For example, Frieling's stated capacities are often confusing and not clearly defined, so you might need to contact Freiling to ask questions prior to purchase, or read the below. Do so when shopping Bodum, BonJour, Frieling, or any brand of French Press. To eliminate confusion, you need to know the actual, always lesser, YIELD of served coffee in fluid ounces, not the maximum capacity, to the brim, of the French Presses you are comparing. If in doubt, go larger. A REVIEW OF THE FRIELING FRENCH PRESSPROS:1) FRIELING OWNERS ON AMAZON VOTE IT AN AVERAGE OF 4.7 STARS, 94% POSITIVE. You might have noticed that few products on Amazon are rated that highly.2) FRIELING MAKES FIVE SIZES FOR YOUR DESIRED PORTION SIZE. Frieling's stated sizes are at full capacity, but it is prudent to reduce that maximum capacity by about 26 fluid ounces, depending upon the size chosen, to allow space for the plunger and the inevitable rising head of bloomfoam when hot water hits the ground coffee. Accordingly, Frieling makes FIVE sizes to suit your capacity needs: 8 fl/oz, 16 fl/oz, 23 fl/oz, 36 fl/oz, and 44 fl/oz.3) DOUBLEWALL THERMAL INSULATION. Frieling makes only one model, the Ultimo, in polished or brushed finish. ALL its three main elements are hollow, doublewall insulated: the pot, the handle, AND the lid. So far, it is the only brand or model of French Press, with one exception, to possesses ALL three featuresthe insulated LID in particular. Such insulation will keep your brewing coffee at 195205 degrees F during the entire brewing cycle resulting in maximum flavor and aroma, as verified by the Specialty Coffee Association of America. FrielingUSA states that such insulation retains heat four times longer than a glass French press.4) 18/10 STAINLESS, COMMERCIALGRADE DURABILITY. Unique to Frieling, this heavy duty French Press is made of food grade, foodsafe solid stainless steel, 18/10 (18% chromium, 10% nickel: best quality), heavy gauge stainless steel stock. This quality, special alloy is foodsafe and leadfree, meant for commercial use in hotel roomservice and hotel dining rooms, for finecuisine restaurants, for caterers, and is sold to specialty, highend hotel/restaurant supply houses (still Frieling's primary business). Such high quality steel NEVER rusts or stains, and I mean NEVER. Also, it will never shatter or injure you. Survives dishwasher hell, and comes out looking like new. The Frieling was once under the radar. It is now available to the public at better coffeeware or kitchenware stores, and is available here on Amazon, far from its industrial roots. The interior is brushed, and because the stainless walls are solid all the way through, the plunger cannot scratch off any \"coating\" because there is no coating...so nothing can rust...as so many other reviewers here have confirmed. Neither the high speed metal brushed finish nor the mirror finish will affect its nonrust qualities...it is just a cosmetic thing.5) ITS FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION. Discipline and restraint, with utility in mind, results in the Frieling's handsome, elegant, and understated lines. Appearance has been given a slight nod. It's all business. Even its high polish is not there to WOW at, but to make it easier to clean. There are no false touches present; only the authentic remains. The entire achievement makes it presentable for casual entertaining, even for more formal occasions. A matching sugar and creamer, with spoon, is available. Its tall, slightly narrow profile has a small footprint, taking up little space on the counter or the table. Shopper's note: Confusing an insulated Press with an insulated carafe is a very common blunder. ANY brand of thermal insulated French Press is specifically designed as a brewer, NOT as a thermal carafe or thermos, so brewed coffee MUST be poured into cups IMMEDIATELY after the four minute brewing period or the continued steeping will produce, even if over a minute, an overextracted, bitter, and insipid cup! For leftover coffee, use a preheated thermal carafe or thermos, with a screwon sealed lid, specifically designed to store hot coffee, and to keep it hot, after it is brewed. Actually, it is best not to store coffee. Consume coffee within 1015 minutes for the best flavor. For more coffee simply brew more coffee for the best flavor.6) THE POT'S SMALL SPOUT is dripless due to its lipped design. Not a stray drop on the tablecloth yet after four years of daily use. The spout is small enough to lose minimal heat, and I tested the heat loss by plugging the spout with window pane putty and measured only a one degree F heat loss compared to an open spout when brewing. It therefore needs no mechanism to close the spout. You will discover that the spout is large enough for a quick, steepstopping pour.7) THE INSULATED LID is entirely unique. It is, with one exception, the only INSULATED lid for a French Press to be found by any manufacturer. Heat rises, and as far as heat is concerned, the pot functions as a chimney, focusing heat above, and its opening is where most heat is lost. This lid caps the heat with its tight fit and insulation. The lid's underside dome shape helps assist in that, like a domed teakettle. The overall lid design is critical if you care to brew at the proper 195205 degree F temperature. THIS WAS THE FINAL KICKER IN MY DECISION TO CHOOSE THE FRIELING, along with the other goodies.8) THE INSULATED HANDLE is crafted of hollow, extruded stainless, all of a piece, to keep it cool, as well as to keep it llight weight so as not to unsteady the pot. The handle's vertical upright is ovoid in crosssection to provide comfort for the gripping fingers. A secure niche for the thumb is provided with its horizontal thumb rest and thumbblock. An often overlooked feature in cup or French Press design, because if the thumb rests on on a horizontal support, especially if that support is provided with a means of blocking the thumb from slipping off, one's grip is then very secure indeed. Take a look at the photo of the handle on this site, you'll see it. The long, vertical provides plenty of clearance for the fingers, and is angled inward toward the bottom to secure the fingers, also to provide good leverage when pouring.9) THE PLUNGER, when pushed down, results in a dynamic turbulence that agitates the water and grounds to intensify flavors...this is the heart of the Press, and what makes French Press what it is. It also separates the grounds from the coffee, so it is fitted to precise specifications to minimize stray grounds coming through the filter or from between the pot's inner walls and the periphery of the plunger, and thence into the cup. The unit is entirely crafted from 18/10 stainless steel (the best grade)...no plastic parts to retain stale tastes whatsoever. Easy to dissemble for cleaning and spare parts are always available. Remember, with ANY French Press you will have stray grounds, especially if you buy canned coffee because it is always ground too fine for French Press, or if you use anything but a burr grinder. Even so, tiny grounds sneak in...French Pressists never sip that last sip: don't blame the Frieling Press, or a Bodum, or a BonJour.10) REPLACEMENT PARTS AND EXCHANGES FOR VALID PROBLEMS ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE. My online and telephone experience with Frieling USA has been excellent. They will replace any product or part you feel is defective. Also, down the line, parts such as the filter screen. cross plate, spiral plate of the plunger assembly, or the plunger rod, are available at very reasonable prices.11) FRIELING KEEPS GOOD COMPANY. Beside Amazon, the finest, most prestigious online coffee gear retailers carry it: cateringplanet, wholelattelove, seattlecoffeegear, clivecoffee, terroircoffee, williamssonoma, espressozone, shop. illy, chriscoffee, liquidplanet, roaste, crateandbarrel, coffee. become, coffeebydesign, coffeeart, veniacoffee, greentreecoffee, blacksmithcoffee, wayfair, etc.12) USEFUL FOR MAKING \"OPEN POT\" COFFEE. You can also use this for \"OPEN POT\" brewing, the simple, \"connoisseur's method,\" also called \"Cowboy Coffee.\" With this method, you simply dose a pot with coffee, pour in offboil water, and steep with the lid on, but with the plunger extended just, stir three times during the steep, after the four minute steep pour through a fine filter into your cup. The flavor is similar to French Pressed coffee.13) USEFUL AS AN INSULATED SERVING PITCHER FOR HOT OR COLD DRINKS. Use the Freiling for serving cold juices, milk, or ice water; use it for serving hot syrup, hot chocolate, hot milk, etc.14) EASY TO CLEAN. The Freiling is dishwasher safe and that will remove any water spots or fingerprints with ease. The plunger filter assembly does not need to be taken apart to clean. Handwashing is often used when camping. Coffee oils build up on grinders and coffee makers of any kind...same here. So, periodically, when you see a thin brown film, use a watervinegar solution and let soak overnight, then scrub well. CONS:1) THE LID CAN SLIP FORWARD A BIT WHEN POURING: The lid is snug for pressing, but while pouring, the lid can slip forward a half inch or so. Solutionthe \"teapot pour\", the way waitstaff use it: with the finger(s) of one hand, lightly press down on the lid, the other hand grips the handle to pour. Or, use the \"onehand pour\": grip the handle with your fingers, press down lightly with side of your thumb upon the flat of the lid's back edge, or use the index finger as another reviewer here mentioned, then pour...easy and secure. If you are extremely heatsensitive just use a potholder to hold to lid. I never need to, and neither do my Frieling French Press using friends, including my daughter.2) A FEW SMALL PARTICLES OF GRIND CAN CATCH IN THE PLUNGER, in the tiny screen seam. SolutionIf that happens, then after brewing and rinsing out your Frieling, fill with hot water, replace lid and plunger. Then, pumping vigorously up and down a few times, the turbulence removes the particles. I seldom have to do that twice or use a small brush. Then place the pot and plunger in the dishwasher.3) FRIELING'S SIZING IS CONFUSING CUSTOMERS: Capacities of Frieling's presses are often expressed in two capacities: he \"serving\" capacity and the \"maximum capacity\" when used as a serving carafe for liquids other than coffee. Very often the \"serving capacity\" is not accurate, serving less than the amount stated. Moreover, various vendors, Amazon sellers, and other retailers list the same model at different capacities. It is maddening. Not only that, but most customers do not know that the \"cups\" Frieling and all coffee manufacturers refer to are actually the European \"Tasse\" cup of 4.22 fluid oz each (1/8 liter, 125ml), NOT the US 8oz measuring cup, so customers often feel misinformed when coffee servings are HALF what they expected. Frieling is innocent of misrepresentation here: it is customer ignorance that is at fault. Regardless, Frieling needs to address this issue ASAP and give us the ACTUAL YIELD per serving, in US fluid ounces, of each size offered. CONCLUSIONThe Frieling French presses are a commercial, industrial design with commercialgrade stainless, insulated everywhere, including the lid, easier to clean than with plastic parts that also retain flavors. Holds the brew temperature at the correct SCAA recommended 195205 degrees, the most important brewing feature of all. Dishwasher hardy and cleanup is easy. Handsome and presentable for entertaining. Durable to the maximum. Excellent, all stainless plunger, few stray particles, produces minimal silt. Highly recommended. 4.8 Amazon stars.

LA CAFETIERE THERMIQUE 8c, $35, 4.2 stars: NO plastics, INSULATED LID, drips, MIXED REVIEWS, stable. P.S. Most of the above brands and models, Bodum and BonJour in particular, I respect for their overall quality, if not for the plastic parts. They, and Frieling, all make similar coffee, but with varying degrees of insulation efficiency and thus very noticeable flavorintensity outcomes. Being consumergrade products, they are not expected to be as durable as commercialgrade equivalents, such as Frieling, due to their intended work environment. Consequently, their comparison with the Frieling is a bit unfair...like comparing apples to oranges. Always buy commercial products whenever possible...the tough guys. By the way, if you remain loyal to glassbeakered Presses, the doubleglass wall, insulated version of the iconic Bodum Chambord 8c ($80) is available (being that glass holds in heat better than metal, I can recommend it), but a replacement beaker is $50, $130 total Amazon. If insulation is not important to you, the glass beakered, single walled, Bodum Eileen ($67 Amazon for the 8c), with its \"full metal perforated jacket\" of stainless, is widely used in French restaurants and bistros as a commercial Press; it is fairly durable for a single wall Press due to the metal sheath, but its single wall will NOT keep the brew at the right temperature. A REBUTTAL OF THE MOST COMMON CRITICAL REVIEWS, AND SOME OVER THE TOP ONESTHE COMMON ONES1) \"Some grounds and silt bypass the filter and are in my cup.\" Answer: some will always pass through, it is a French Press thing, common to all brands and models...French Pressists never take that last sip. But there are three ways to dramatically reduce that, 1) the fault, almost invariably, USING A WHIRLYBLADE GRINDER, or the LACK OF A CONICAL BURR GRINDER that allows you to grind EVENLY and COARSELY, no more dustandboulders; or b) not grinding COARSELY enough with any grinder; or c) buying CANNED OR PACKAGED PREGROUND coffee ground FINE for drip coffee so that fine grounds can bypass the French Press's filter. Grind mediumcourse for French Press, not\" fine. If you have no good grinder then have your coffee source grind it coarsely for you.2) \"My coffee does not stay hot very long after I pour it.\" Answer: ANY brand of French Press is designed to BREW coffee, and NOT TO STORE IT. Period. Stainless Steel, or glass, doublewalled Presses are designed to keep the brewing coffee at the correct temperature (195205 degrees) DURING THE BREW CYCLE and are NOT MEANT TO STORE COFFEE AFTER THE BREW CYCLE IS COMPLETED. If the steep goes much past 4 minutes you get nasty coffeeoverextracted and bitter. I am convinced that the confusion comes from mistaking what it looks like: an insulated pot \"looks\" like a thermos, or insulated carafe. Well, it's not. It's a brewer. Timing is critical when making any coffee. Espresso Baristas use a timer to cut short their pull at 2530 seconds per shot, with French Press (and drip) set your timer to 3.5 to 4.5 minutes per extraction (4 minutes is the sweet spot).3)\"I get this metallic taste (or bitter taste, or stale taste, take your pick).\" Stainless steel, especially foodgrade 18/10 stainless used in the Frieling, is famed for imparting ZERO taste to food or beverages. It's what it's known for. The offtastes come from other sources such as, a) coffeol oil and collagen residues adhering to the Press wall, or in your grinder, or both...keep them clean, or 2) certain coffees give off unusual flavor notes also, or c) your water might be less than ideal, or d) your dishwash detergent is not thoroughly rinsed off. It's NOT the metal itself. THE OVERTHETOP ONES\"The handle breaks off,\" or \"has a sloppy weld.\" Or, \"Cannot clean the thing at all.\" Or, \"I get gray powder on my paper towel when I wipe it out.\" Answer: These are over the top, spoiler, dealkilling statements and are intended to be so, for various malicious reasons, I remain convinced, and so utterly lacking in truth that they are laughable. The laserweld on the handle is so secure that the restaurant supply managers I personally know say they have never experienced any handle failures or sloppy welds, none, ever. Dirty Stainless is not 18/10 stainless's fault, so if really neglected use foodservice's favorite: Barkeeper's Friend, use it gently, rinse. Lastly...\"It shows fingerprints all the time, and spots\"...uh, well, wipe them off, how hard is that? Or sell it on ebay and buy the new matte brushedfinish Frieling. Gray powder on the inside? Not possible with 18/10 Stainless...has to be bad water or bad dishwashing detergent, come on, think of a better pot shot. Frieling's positive 4 & 5 star reviews are 94% of the total here. That is highly unusual on Amazon. So don't worry, the $75 is only about $10 more than the lesser Bodums you might be shopping. It is money well spent, lasting for many, many years. I cherish my Frieling, and so will you. THE COFFEE HOUSE FRENCH PRESS BREW METHOD: The Hows and Whys USE CLEAN, COLD WATER. Brewing with a French Press is simple and easy. You have to know how to do it and WHY you are doing it to extract the most flavor possible. Essentially, your water flavor must be good so you begin by using cold, filtered water. You fill your kettle with TWICE the water needed: half to prewarm your Press and the other half for brewing. USE THE RIGHT DOSE OF COFFEE BEANS. Dose coffee beans at 5565g of coffee beans per liter of water, or 70 grams if you \"break and clean\" (rather than stirring the bloom, you break the bloom foam cake and spoon out the surface grounds to reduce the fines, in which case you sacrifice some brewing grounds, so you need to overdose a bit). Use a kitchen scale to measure. BEGIN GRINDING THE BEANS JUST BEFORE THE WATER BOILS. Once the bean husk is cracked open favor immediately escapes, so wait until the last minute to grind, just as the water begins to boil. BREW AT THE CORRECT TEMPERATURE. As the water almost boils, start your grinder, prewarm your Press with half the offboil water, empty the Press and fill with the grounds weighed on a scale. Then pour in the other half of the water, using a scale to measure, at about 205208 degrees F so as the temperature drops during the brew you are NEVER brewing lower than 195 degrees F. NEVER begin at 195 degrees F or flavor really suffers as the temp at brew's end can even drop to 185 degrees F...not good! BREW FOR THE CORRECT TIME. A fourminute brew cycle is highly recommended. Anything less gives you a raw, underextracted cup, anything more gives you an overcooked, overextracted, bitter cup. At Brew's end, ALWAYS pour out coffee into cups to terminate the brewing. NEVER store coffee in any coffee brewer as it will continue to brew! Even with drip brewing coffee is stored in a carafe...do that same here. A coffee brewer of any kind is NOT a coffee storage carafe. That is a job for a thermally insulated carafe. The insulation in a French Press is there to keep the brew at the correct temperature DURING the brew cycle. BREWING IT: An upclose look at brewing French Press Coffee1. FILL KETTLE with at least TWICE the water needed to brew. Use only fresh, neverboiled, COLD, FILTERED water, not the nasty tasting, mildly rusty hot water sitting inside your hot water heater. Now begin heating your water at high heat.2. WEIGH YOUR BEANS. While the water heats, place your grinder's groundscollecting bin on your scales, then tare to zero. After weighing, pour the beans into the grinder's hopper, then place the grounds bin in the grinder to catch the grounds when you grind.3. GRIND YOUR BEANS. Set your grinder to a mid coarse setting, as coarse as coarsely ground pepper, and experiment to get the dosage just right for your taste...I like the finer side of coarse. When your water almost boils, at about 210211 degrees F, turn off the heat and start your grinder and let the water temp drop a bit in the meantime.4. WEIGH WATER AS YOU POUR, THEN STEEP. While the grinder is grinding, pour hot water into your Press to warm it. When the grinding is completed, pour the warming water from the Press into your cup(s) to prewarm them, discard remaining water from the Press. Then pour your coffee grounds to the Press and place your Press on your scales, tare the Press to zero. To monitor heat place a thermometer in your Press. Now pour in the kettle's remaining 205208 degree F water into the Press as shown on your scale (I use 870900g in my 1 liter Press). Place the lid on the Press with plunger extended upward to begin the brewing cycle. Set your timer to 4 minutes.5. STIR, SINK, OR SCOOP OFF THE BLOOM. After after one minute, either gently stir, or sink the bloom with a spoon, or remove (break) the cake \"crust\" with a soup spoon (or two) to gently scoop to remove (clean) the bloom off the top to reduce the amount of fines in the brew. Be sure no grounds remain above the plunger or in the spout as those grounds will end up in your cup.6. REPLACE THE LID AND FINISH BREWING. With the lid on, continue to brew until the timer beeps, then press the plunger down VERY SLOWLY to the bottom (to reduce agitation of any fines present). Pour out the warming water from your cup(s), THEN pour in the hot coffee from the Press to replace it. Serve and enjoy. This is the ambrosia people are talking about...properly made French Press. Hoping to cover all the bases, and to eliminate any confusion, I have gone into great detail so you know not only HOW to properly make French Press, but also WHY you make it that way. Making French Press is actually a very simple ritual once you do it a few times, much simpler than it appears in the above. NOTE: The French Press pictured above is the highly regarded doublewalled insulated Frieling Ultimo French Press made of 100% 18/10 stainless steel with a stainless steel lid and parts..no plastic parts in the lid or filter plunger. The Frieling is a fine hotel and restaurant grade product available in five sizes. Available in mirror polished or brushed matte finishes. I hope this was helpful to you. If you have questions, please reply in the Comment section...I would be glad to help. MY NEW BLOG: thegoodstuffreviews. blogspot. com\n",

      "\"One chews coffee beans while gargling 200 F water for four minutes; pressing with the tongue, coffee is filtered through the teeth: is this the French press you refer to?\"  M. PythonAN INTRODUCTION TO COFFEE AMBROSIA. It's a quest for flavor. It's all about flavor. You are here searching for the best quality French Press, one that delivers the most flavorful coffee possible. You might be new to French Press and are rightly skeptical about the vulnerability and safety of a glass model. Or, you might be experienced, a Bodum or BonJour refugee exasperated by having to replace your second, or third, or even your seventh broken glass beaker. No cuts? Lucky you. Been there. Below: First is a look at buying a French Press, followed by a Review of the Frieling French Press, then info on grinders, accessories, buying coffee, and brewing the best French Press. SHOPPING FOR A FRENCH PRESS: WHAT TO LOOK FORFIRST, WHAT IS FRENCH PRESS? Call it French Press, Press Pot, Cafetiere, Plunger Pot, Pressed Coffee, Coffee Press, or Cafe a Piston, it is all the same. Invented by an Italian man, popularized in France, \"French Press\" has emigrated to North America. The apparatus itself is strikingly simple: A handled pot, a lid, and a plunger. A French Press can be made of glass, metal, plastic, or ceramic. The pot is never placed on a stove burner...hot water is poured over ground coffee and steeped a few minutes, the plunger is pressed down, the brewed coffee is then poured into cups. French Press is a handson brewing method that allows the user to control brewing variables, adjusting for personal taste. This is a fullimmersion brewing method where the bed of grounds can steep, or soak, for a few minutes prior to pressing to terminate the brewing, thereby remarkably intensifying the brew's flavors and aromas when properly brewed using proper equipment. Usually, coarsely ground coffee beans are poured into the Press followed by offtheboil water, allowed to steep about four minutes at the correct temperature, then the pistonlike, porous filter plunger is slowly pressed down to filter and separate the grounds from the brewed coffee just prior to serving. A simple ritual indeed. In order to brew French Press you need a French Press. So, for shrewd shopping, French Press design features are discussed below...SIMPLICITY. No unnecessary parts means less parts to fail or to clean. ROBUST CONSTRUCTION: Your pot,lid and plunger should be of sturdy, durable construction using rustfree metals such as foodgrade stainless steel, high impact, BPAfree plastics, borosilicate glass, or quality ceramics with foodsafe glazes. The most durable, heavyduty quality is heavyduty restaurant/hotel commercial grade rather than the far less durable, lightduty consumer grade. INSULATION: Coffee Science has confirmed that coffee should be brewed at between 195 and 205 degrees F during the ENTIRE brewing cycle to release as much flavor and aroma as possible. The brewing cycle is usually four minutes for French Press. To keep temperatures within this range during the brewing cycle requires an INSULATED French Press. French Press designs that will do so are: thermal doublewall stainless or glass, thickwall ceramic designs, or inexpensive \"thermos\" designs. A heads up: An INSULATED French Press is a dedicated coffee BREWER, and is NOT a coffee storage vessel designed to store coffee after brewing...therefore it should NOT be confused with an INSULATED \"thermos,\" a design dedicated only to STORING hot or cold beverages. So, after brewing, immediately pour ALL coffee into cups or into an insulated thermos. This will immediately terminate brewing to avoid overextraction, producing a bitter cup. DISHWASHER SAFE. Ensure that your Press is dishwasher safe, and is easy to clean if handwashed. Look for hidden corners or crevices. Insist on dishwasher safe highheat resistant materials. EFFECTIVE FILTER. Your plunger's filter screen, the metal mesh, must filter, or separate, coffee grounds from the brewed coffee. The finer the screen the better it does so, BUT, and I mean the BIG BUT...no matter how good your grinder is, or your filter, some very fine particles will always make it through the filter, ending up at the bottom of your cup. It cannot be helped. Why?Because if the screen is too fine, almost solid, all grounds might be filtered out, but then it might be impossible to push the plunger to the bottom because of the resistance encountered when coffee cannot pass through the filter, yet if the filter screen is too porous then the amount of \"fines\" coming through the filter screen will markedly increase. The solution?Aside from optimal filter porosity, a quality burr grinder is key in reducing to a minimum the amount of \"fines\" coming into your cup. Even still, do not take the last sip...a bit of silt in the cup is a French Press thing...part of its reality, part of its pleasure...the price you pay for excellence in the cup. COMFORTABLE, SECURE HANDLE. You need a comfortable, secure, insulated handle. Look for a handle with a horizontal grip for the thumb and clearance for the fingers. Your handle should stay cool, especially when pouring. Its grip design should be comfy and encourage a confident, accurate pour. STABLE POT. Your Press should be stable enough to resist accidental tipping when struck: A Press can have tall proportions IF the weight is substantial. A base smaller that the width at any point is not a good design. DRIPLESS SPOUT. Your French Press should never drip or dribble when pouring...return it if it does so. Good design prevents that. SAFE TO USE. Your Press must be safe to use when not fully awake in the morning. As you know, accidents and fumbles can happen, so avoid materials that might shatter, crack, or injure you, as well as needing replacement. Only foodgrade 18/5 or the better 18/10 stainless steel should be used. Glass beakers should be highheat resistant, Pyrex type borosilicate glass. If plastics are used, ensure that they are foodsafe, BPAfree, and are not porous enough to harbor bacteria (or harbor stale coffee tastes and aromas). If ceramics are used, ensure that the glazes are food safe, cadmium and cobaltfree, or FDA approved. MATCHING YOUR FRENCH PRESS SIZE TO YOUR DESIRED COFFEE SERVING SIZEBUY THE RIGHT SIZE FOR YOUR DESIRED SERVING SIZE : When brewing fill the press no higher than an inch or more from the brim, or to the V at the bottom of the spout. This reduces capacity, but prevents coffee ejecting from the spout when pressing down. Room MUST be allowed for the halfinch to oneinch thick CO2 caused foamy \"bloom\" to rise, the water displacement of the plunger and spillage room. Do not forget the volume of the grounds either, and the 24 ounces of water retained by the grounds after pouring. Because of the facts mentioned above, any \"tothebrim\" capacity claimed by the maker must be adjusted downward by at least 26 fl. oz., in proportion to the size of the press. This goes for ALL brands and models of French Press products. For example, Frieling's stated capacities are often confusing and not clearly defined, so you might need to contact Freiling to ask questions prior to purchase, or read the below. Do so when shopping Bodum, BonJour, Frieling, or any brand of French Press. To eliminate confusion, you need to know the actual, always lesser, YIELD of served coffee in fluid ounces, not the maximum capacity, to the brim, of the French Presses you are comparing. If in doubt, go larger. A REVIEW OF THE FRIELING FRENCH PRESSPROS:1) FRIELING OWNERS ON AMAZON VOTE IT AN AVERAGE OF 4.7 STARS, 94% POSITIVE. You might have noticed that few products on Amazon are rated that highly.2) FRIELING MAKES FIVE SIZES FOR YOUR DESIRED PORTION SIZE. Frieling's stated sizes are at full capacity, but it is prudent to reduce that maximum capacity by about 26 fluid ounces, depending upon the size chosen, to allow space for the plunger and the inevitable rising head of bloomfoam when hot water hits the ground coffee. Accordingly, Frieling makes FIVE sizes to suit your capacity needs: 8 fl/oz, 16 fl/oz, 23 fl/oz, 36 fl/oz, and 44 fl/oz.3) DOUBLEWALL THERMAL INSULATION. Frieling makes only one model, the Ultimo, in polished or brushed finish. ALL its three main elements are hollow, doublewall insulated: the pot, the handle, AND the lid. So far, it is the only brand or model of French Press, with one exception, to possesses ALL three featuresthe insulated LID in particular. Such insulation will keep your brewing coffee at 195205 degrees F during the entire brewing cycle resulting in maximum flavor and aroma, as verified by the Specialty Coffee Association of America. FrielingUSA states that such insulation retains heat four times longer than a glass French press.4) 18/10 STAINLESS, COMMERCIALGRADE DURABILITY. Unique to Frieling, this heavy duty French Press is made of food grade, foodsafe solid stainless steel, 18/10 (18% chromium, 10% nickel: best quality), heavy gauge stainless steel stock. This quality, special alloy is foodsafe and leadfree, meant for commercial use in hotel roomservice and hotel dining rooms, for finecuisine restaurants, for caterers, and is sold to specialty, highend hotel/restaurant supply houses (still Frieling's primary business). Such high quality steel NEVER rusts or stains, and I mean NEVER. Also, it will never shatter or injure you. Survives dishwasher hell, and comes out looking like new. The Frieling was once under the radar. It is now available to the public at better coffeeware or kitchenware stores, and is available here on Amazon, far from its industrial roots. The interior is brushed, and because the stainless walls are solid all the way through, the plunger cannot scratch off any \"coating\" because there is no coating...so nothing can rust...as so many other reviewers here have confirmed. Neither the high speed metal brushed finish nor the mirror finish will affect its nonrust qualities...it is just a cosmetic thing.5) ITS FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION. Discipline and restraint, with utility in mind, results in the Frieling's handsome, elegant, and understated lines. Appearance has been given a slight nod. It's all business. Even its high polish is not there to WOW at, but to make it easier to clean. There are no false touches present; only the authentic remains. The entire achievement makes it presentable for casual entertaining, even for more formal occasions. A matching sugar and creamer, with spoon, is available. Its tall, slightly narrow profile has a small footprint, taking up little space on the counter or the table. Shopper's note: Confusing an insulated Press with an insulated carafe is a very common blunder. ANY brand of thermal insulated French Press is specifically designed as a brewer, NOT as a thermal carafe or thermos, so brewed coffee MUST be poured into cups IMMEDIATELY after the four minute brewing period or the continued steeping will produce, even if over a minute, an overextracted, bitter, and insipid cup! For leftover coffee, use a preheated thermal carafe or thermos, with a screwon sealed lid, specifically designed to store hot coffee, and to keep it hot, after it is brewed. Actually, it is best not to store coffee. Consume coffee within 1015 minutes for the best flavor. For more coffee simply brew more coffee for the best flavor.6) THE POT'S SMALL SPOUT is dripless due to its lipped design. Not a stray drop on the tablecloth yet after four years of daily use. The spout is small enough to lose minimal heat, and I tested the heat loss by plugging the spout with window pane putty and measured only a one degree F heat loss compared to an open spout when brewing. It therefore needs no mechanism to close the spout. You will discover that the spout is large enough for a quick, steepstopping pour.7) THE INSULATED LID is entirely unique. It is, with one exception, the only INSULATED lid for a French Press to be found by any manufacturer. Heat rises, and as far as heat is concerned, the pot functions as a chimney, focusing heat above, and its opening is where most heat is lost. This lid caps the heat with its tight fit and insulation. The lid's underside dome shape helps assist in that, like a domed teakettle. The overall lid design is critical if you care to brew at the proper 195205 degree F temperature. THIS WAS THE FINAL KICKER IN MY DECISION TO CHOOSE THE FRIELING, along with the other goodies.8) THE INSULATED HANDLE is crafted of hollow, extruded stainless, all of a piece, to keep it cool, as well as to keep it llight weight so as not to unsteady the pot. The handle's vertical upright is ovoid in crosssection to provide comfort for the gripping fingers. A secure niche for the thumb is provided with its horizontal thumb rest and thumbblock. An often overlooked feature in cup or French Press design, because if the thumb rests on on a horizontal support, especially if that support is provided with a means of blocking the thumb from slipping off, one's grip is then very secure indeed. Take a look at the photo of the handle on this site, you'll see it. The long, vertical provides plenty of clearance for the fingers, and is angled inward toward the bottom to secure the fingers, also to provide good leverage when pouring.9) THE PLUNGER, when pushed down, results in a dynamic turbulence that agitates the water and grounds to intensify flavors...this is the heart of the Press, and what makes French Press what it is. It also separates the grounds from the coffee, so it is fitted to precise specifications to minimize stray grounds coming through the filter or from between the pot's inner walls and the periphery of the plunger, and thence into the cup. The unit is entirely crafted from 18/10 stainless steel (the best grade)...no plastic parts to retain stale tastes whatsoever. Easy to dissemble for cleaning and spare parts are always available. Remember, with ANY French Press you will have stray grounds, especially if you buy canned coffee because it is always ground too fine for French Press, or if you use anything but a burr grinder. Even so, tiny grounds sneak in...French Pressists never sip that last sip: don't blame the Frieling Press, or a Bodum, or a BonJour.10) REPLACEMENT PARTS AND EXCHANGES FOR VALID PROBLEMS ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE. My online and telephone experience with Frieling USA has been excellent. They will replace any product or part you feel is defective. Also, down the line, parts such as the filter screen. cross plate, spiral plate of the plunger assembly, or the plunger rod, are available at very reasonable prices.11) FRIELING KEEPS GOOD COMPANY. Beside Amazon, the finest, most prestigious online coffee gear retailers carry it: cateringplanet, wholelattelove, seattlecoffeegear, clivecoffee, terroircoffee, williamssonoma, espressozone, shop. illy, chriscoffee, liquidplanet, roaste, crateandbarrel, coffee. become, coffeebydesign, coffeeart, veniacoffee, greentreecoffee, blacksmithcoffee, wayfair, etc.12) USEFUL FOR MAKING \"OPEN POT\" COFFEE. You can also use this for \"OPEN POT\" brewing, the simple, \"connoisseur's method,\" also called \"Cowboy Coffee.\" With this method, you simply dose a pot with coffee, pour in offboil water, and steep with the lid on, but with the plunger extended just, stir three times during the steep, after the four minute steep pour through a fine filter into your cup. The flavor is similar to French Pressed coffee.13) USEFUL AS AN INSULATED SERVING PITCHER FOR HOT OR COLD DRINKS. Use the Freiling for serving cold juices, milk, or ice water; use it for serving hot syrup, hot chocolate, hot milk, etc.14) EASY TO CLEAN. The Freiling is dishwasher safe and that will remove any water spots or fingerprints with ease. The plunger filter assembly does not need to be taken apart to clean. Handwashing is often used when camping. Coffee oils build up on grinders and coffee makers of any kind...same here. So, periodically, when you see a thin brown film, use a watervinegar solution and let soak overnight, then scrub well. CONS:1) THE LID CAN SLIP FORWARD A BIT WHEN POURING: The lid is snug for pressing, but while pouring, the lid can slip forward a half inch or so. Solutionthe \"teapot pour\", the way waitstaff use it: with the finger(s) of one hand, lightly press down on the lid, the other hand grips the handle to pour. Or, use the \"onehand pour\": grip the handle with your fingers, press down lightly with side of your thumb upon the flat of the lid's back edge, or use the index finger as another reviewer here mentioned, then pour...easy and secure. If you are extremely heatsensitive just use a potholder to hold to lid. I never need to, and neither do my Frieling French Press using friends, including my daughter.2) A FEW SMALL PARTICLES OF GRIND CAN CATCH IN THE PLUNGER, in the tiny screen seam. SolutionIf that happens, then after brewing and rinsing out your Frieling, fill with hot water, replace lid and plunger. Then, pumping vigorously up and down a few times, the turbulence removes the particles. I seldom have to do that twice or use a small brush. Then place the pot and plunger in the dishwasher.3) FRIELING'S SIZING IS CONFUSING CUSTOMERS: Capacities of Frieling's presses are often expressed in two capacities: he \"serving\" capacity and the \"maximum capacity\" when used as a serving carafe for liquids other than coffee. Very often the \"serving capacity\" is not accurate, serving less than the amount stated. Moreover, various vendors, Amazon sellers, and other retailers list the same model at different capacities. It is maddening. Not only that, but most customers do not know that the \"cups\" Frieling and all coffee manufacturers refer to are actually the European \"Tasse\" cup of 4.22 fluid oz each (1/8 liter, 125ml), NOT the US 8oz measuring cup, so customers often feel misinformed when coffee servings are HALF what they expected. Frieling is innocent of misrepresentation here: it is customer ignorance that is at fault. Regardless, Frieling needs to address this issue ASAP and give us the ACTUAL YIELD per serving, in US fluid ounces, of each size offered. CONCLUSIONThe Frieling French presses are a commercial, industrial design with commercialgrade stainless, insulated everywhere, including the lid, easier to clean than with plastic parts that also retain flavors. Holds the brew temperature at the correct SCAA recommended 195205 degrees, the most important brewing feature of all. Dishwasher hardy and cleanup is easy. Handsome and presentable for entertaining. Durable to the maximum. Excellent, all stainless plunger, few stray particles, produces minimal silt. Highly recommended. 4.8 Amazon stars.

LA CAFETIERE THERMIQUE 8c, $35, 4.2 stars: NO plastics, INSULATED LID, drips, MIXED REVIEWS, stable. P.S. Most of the above brands and models, Bodum and BonJour in particular, I respect for their overall quality, if not for the plastic parts. They, and Frieling, all make similar coffee, but with varying degrees of insulation efficiency and thus very noticeable flavorintensity outcomes. Being consumergrade products, they are not expected to be as durable as commercialgrade equivalents, such as Frieling, due to their intended work environment. Consequently, their comparison with the Frieling is a bit unfair...like comparing apples to oranges. Always buy commercial products whenever possible...the tough guys. By the way, if you remain loyal to glassbeakered Presses, the doubleglass wall, insulated version of the iconic Bodum Chambord 8c ($80) is available (being that glass holds in heat better than metal, I can recommend it), but a replacement beaker is $50, $130 total Amazon. If insulation is not important to you, the glass beakered, single walled, Bodum Eileen ($67 Amazon for the 8c), with its \"full metal perforated jacket\" of stainless, is widely used in French restaurants and bistros as a commercial Press; it is fairly durable for a single wall Press due to the metal sheath, but its single wall will NOT keep the brew at the right temperature. A REBUTTAL OF THE MOST COMMON CRITICAL REVIEWS, AND SOME OVER THE TOP ONESTHE COMMON ONES1) \"Some grounds and silt bypass the filter and are in my cup.\" Answer: some will always pass through, it is a French Press thing, common to all brands and models...French Pressists never take that last sip. But there are three ways to dramatically reduce that, 1) the fault, almost invariably, USING A WHIRLYBLADE GRINDER, or the LACK OF A CONICAL BURR GRINDER that allows you to grind EVENLY and COARSELY, no more dustandboulders; or b) not grinding COARSELY enough with any grinder; or c) buying CANNED OR PACKAGED PREGROUND coffee ground FINE for drip coffee so that fine grounds can bypass the French Press's filter. Grind mediumcourse for French Press, not\" fine. If you have no good grinder then have your coffee source grind it coarsely for you.2) \"My coffee does not stay hot very long after I pour it.\" Answer: ANY brand of French Press is designed to BREW coffee, and NOT TO STORE IT. Period. Stainless Steel, or glass, doublewalled Presses are designed to keep the brewing coffee at the correct temperature (195205 degrees) DURING THE BREW CYCLE and are NOT MEANT TO STORE COFFEE AFTER THE BREW CYCLE IS COMPLETED. If the steep goes much past 4 minutes you get nasty coffeeoverextracted and bitter. I am convinced that the confusion comes from mistaking what it looks like: an insulated pot \"looks\" like a thermos, or insulated carafe. Well, it's not. It's a brewer. Timing is critical when making any coffee. Espresso Baristas use a timer to cut short their pull at 2530 seconds per shot, with French Press (and drip) set your timer to 3.5 to 4.5 minutes per extraction (4 minutes is the sweet spot).3)\"I get this metallic taste (or bitter taste, or stale taste, take your pick).\" Stainless steel, especially foodgrade 18/10 stainless used in the Frieling, is famed for imparting ZERO taste to food or beverages. It's what it's known for. The offtastes come from other sources such as, a) coffeol oil and collagen residues adhering to the Press wall, or in your grinder, or both...keep them clean, or 2) certain coffees give off unusual flavor notes also, or c) your water might be less than ideal, or d) your dishwash detergent is not thoroughly rinsed off. It's NOT the metal itself. THE OVERTHETOP ONES\"The handle breaks off,\" or \"has a sloppy weld.\" Or, \"Cannot clean the thing at all.\" Or, \"I get gray powder on my paper towel when I wipe it out.\" Answer: These are over the top, spoiler, dealkilling statements and are intended to be so, for various malicious reasons, I remain convinced, and so utterly lacking in truth that they are laughable. The laserweld on the handle is so secure that the restaurant supply managers I personally know say they have never experienced any handle failures or sloppy welds, none, ever. Dirty Stainless is not 18/10 stainless's fault, so if really neglected use foodservice's favorite: Barkeeper's Friend, use it gently, rinse. Lastly...\"It shows fingerprints all the time, and spots\"...uh, well, wipe them off, how hard is that? Or sell it on ebay and buy the new matte brushedfinish Frieling. Gray powder on the inside? Not possible with 18/10 Stainless...has to be bad water or bad dishwashing detergent, come on, think of a better pot shot. Frieling's positive 4 & 5 star reviews are 94% of the total here. That is highly unusual on Amazon. So don't worry, the $75 is only about $10 more than the lesser Bodums you might be shopping. It is money well spent, lasting for many, many years. I cherish my Frieling, and so will you. THE COFFEE HOUSE FRENCH PRESS BREW METHOD: The Hows and Whys USE CLEAN, COLD WATER. Brewing with a French Press is simple and easy. You have to know how to do it and WHY you are doing it to extract the most flavor possible. Essentially, your water flavor must be good so you begin by using cold, filtered water. You fill your kettle with TWICE the water needed: half to prewarm your Press and the other half for brewing. USE THE RIGHT DOSE OF COFFEE BEANS. Dose coffee beans at 5565g of coffee beans per liter of water, or 70 grams if you \"break and clean\" (rather than stirring the bloom, you break the bloom foam cake and spoon out the surface grounds to reduce the fines, in which case you sacrifice some brewing grounds, so you need to overdose a bit). Use a kitchen scale to measure. BEGIN GRINDING THE BEANS JUST BEFORE THE WATER BOILS. Once the bean husk is cracked open favor immediately escapes, so wait until the last minute to grind, just as the water begins to boil. BREW AT THE CORRECT TEMPERATURE. As the water almost boils, start your grinder, prewarm your Press with half the offboil water, empty the Press and fill with the grounds weighed on a scale. Then pour in the other half of the water, using a scale to measure, at about 205208 degrees F so as the temperature drops during the brew you are NEVER brewing lower than 195 degrees F. NEVER begin at 195 degrees F or flavor really suffers as the temp at brew's end can even drop to 185 degrees F...not good! BREW FOR THE CORRECT TIME. A fourminute brew cycle is highly recommended. Anything less gives you a raw, underextracted cup, anything more gives you an overcooked, overextracted, bitter cup. At Brew's end, ALWAYS pour out coffee into cups to terminate the brewing. NEVER store coffee in any coffee brewer as it will continue to brew! Even with drip brewing coffee is stored in a carafe...do that same here. A coffee brewer of any kind is NOT a coffee storage carafe. That is a job for a thermally insulated carafe. The insulation in a French Press is there to keep the brew at the correct temperature DURING the brew cycle. BREWING IT: An upclose look at brewing French Press Coffee1. FILL KETTLE with at least TWICE the water needed to brew. Use only fresh, neverboiled, COLD, FILTERED water, not the nasty tasting, mildly rusty hot water sitting inside your hot water heater. Now begin heating your water at high heat.2. WEIGH YOUR BEANS. While the water heats, place your grinder's groundscollecting bin on your scales, then tare to zero. After weighing, pour the beans into the grinder's hopper, then place the grounds bin in the grinder to catch the grounds when you grind.3. GRIND YOUR BEANS. Set your grinder to a mid coarse setting, as coarse as coarsely ground pepper, and experiment to get the dosage just right for your taste...I like the finer side of coarse. When your water almost boils, at about 210211 degrees F, turn off the heat and start your grinder and let the water temp drop a bit in the meantime.4. WEIGH WATER AS YOU POUR, THEN STEEP. While the grinder is grinding, pour hot water into your Press to warm it. When the grinding is completed, pour the warming water from the Press into your cup(s) to prewarm them, discard remaining water from the Press. Then pour your coffee grounds to the Press and place your Press on your scales, tare the Press to zero. To monitor heat place a thermometer in your Press. Now pour in the kettle's remaining 205208 degree F water into the Press as shown on your scale (I use 870900g in my 1 liter Press). Place the lid on the Press with plunger extended upward to begin the brewing cycle. Set your timer to 4 minutes.5. STIR, SINK, OR SCOOP OFF THE BLOOM. After after one minute, either gently stir, or sink the bloom with a spoon, or remove (break) the cake \"crust\" with a soup spoon (or two) to gently scoop to remove (clean) the bloom off the top to reduce the amount of fines in the brew. Be sure no grounds remain above the plunger or in the spout as those grounds will end up in your cup.6. REPLACE THE LID AND FINISH BREWING. With the lid on, continue to brew until the timer beeps, then press the plunger down VERY SLOWLY to the bottom (to reduce agitation of any fines present). Pour out the warming water from your cup(s), THEN pour in the hot coffee from the Press to replace it. Serve and enjoy. This is the ambrosia people are talking about...properly made French Press. Note: Hoping to cover all the bases, and to eliminate any confusion, I have gone into great detail so you know not only HOW to properly make French Press, but also WHY you make it that way. Making French Press is actually a very simple ritual once you do it a few times, much simpler than it appears in the above. NOTE: The French Press pictured above is the highly regarded doublewalled insulated Frieling Ultimo French Press made of 100% 18/10 stainless steel with a stainless steel lid and parts..no plastic parts in the lid or filter plunger. The Frieling is a fine hotel and restaurant grade product available in five sizes. Available in mirror polished or brushed matte finishes.

      "\"One chews coffee beans while gargling 200 F water for four minutes; pressing with the tongue, coffee is filtered through the teeth: is this the French press you refer to?\"  M. PythonAN INTRODUCTION TO COFFEE AMBROSIA. It's a quest for flavor. It's all about flavor. You are here searching for the best quality French Press, one that delivers the most flavorful coffee possible. You might be new to French Press and are rightly skeptical about the vulnerability and safety of a glass model. Or, you might be experienced, a Bodum or BonJour refugee exasperated by having to replace your second, or third, or even your seventh broken glass beaker. No cuts? Lucky you. Been there. Below: First is a look at buying a French Press, followed by a Review of the Frieling French Press, then info on grinders, accessories, buying coffee, and brewing the best French Press. SHOPPING FOR A FRENCH PRESS: WHAT TO LOOK FORFIRST, WHAT IS FRENCH PRESS? Call it French Press, Press Pot, Cafetiere, Plunger Pot, Pressed Coffee, Coffee Press, or Cafe a Piston, it is all the same. Invented by an Italian man, popularized in France, \"French Press\" has emigrated to North America. The apparatus itself is strikingly simple: A handled pot, a lid, and a plunger. A French Press can be made of glass, metal, plastic, or ceramic. The pot is never placed on a stove burner...hot water is poured over ground coffee and steeped a few minutes, the plunger is pressed down, the brewed coffee is then poured into cups. French Press is a handson brewing method that allows the user to control brewing variables, adjusting for personal taste. This is a fullimmersion brewing method where the bed of grounds can steep, or soak, for a few minutes prior to pressing to terminate the brewing, thereby remarkably intensifying the brew's flavors and aromas when properly brewed using proper equipment. Usually, coarsely ground coffee beans are poured into the Press followed by offtheboil water, allowed to steep about four minutes at the correct temperature, then the pistonlike, porous filter plunger is slowly pressed down to filter and separate the grounds from the brewed coffee just prior to serving. A simple ritual indeed. In order to brew French Press you need a French Press. So, for shrewd shopping, French Press design features are discussed below...SIMPLICITY. No unnecessary parts means less parts to fail or to clean. ROBUST CONSTRUCTION: Your pot,lid and plunger should be of sturdy, durable construction using rustfree metals such as foodgrade stainless steel, high impact, BPAfree plastics, borosilicate glass, or quality ceramics with foodsafe glazes. The most durable, heavyduty quality is heavyduty restaurant/hotel commercial grade rather than the far less durable, lightduty consumer grade. INSULATION: Coffee Science has confirmed that coffee should be brewed at between 195 and 205 degrees F during the ENTIRE brewing cycle to release as much flavor and aroma as possible. The brewing cycle is usually four minutes for French Press. To keep temperatures within this range during the brewing cycle requires an INSULATED French Press. French Press designs that will do so are: thermal doublewall stainless or glass, thickwall ceramic designs, or inexpensive \"thermos\" designs. A heads up: An INSULATED French Press is a dedicated coffee BREWER, and is NOT a coffee storage vessel designed to store coffee after brewing...therefore it should NOT be confused with an INSULATED \"thermos,\" a design dedicated only to STORING hot or cold beverages. So, after brewing, immediately pour ALL coffee into cups or into an insulated thermos. This will immediately terminate brewing to avoid overextraction, producing a bitter cup. DISHWASHER SAFE. Ensure that your Press is dishwasher safe, and is easy to clean if handwashed. Look for hidden corners or crevices. Insist on dishwasher safe highheat resistant materials. EFFECTIVE FILTER. Your plunger's filter screen, the metal mesh, must filter, or separate, coffee grounds from the brewed coffee. The finer the screen the better it does so, BUT, and I mean the BIG BUT...no matter how good your grinder is, or your filter, some very fine particles will always make it through the filter, ending up at the bottom of your cup. It cannot be helped. Why?Because if the screen is too fine, almost solid, all grounds might be filtered out, but then it might be impossible to push the plunger to the bottom because of the resistance encountered when coffee cannot pass through the filter, yet if the filter screen is too porous then the amount of \"fines\" coming through the filter screen will markedly increase. The solution?Aside from optimal filter porosity, a quality burr grinder is key in reducing to a minimum the amount of \"fines\" coming into your cup. Even still, do not take the last sip...a bit of silt in the cup is a French Press thing...part of its reality, part of its pleasure...the price you pay for excellence in the cup. COMFORTABLE, SECURE HANDLE. You need a comfortable, secure, insulated handle. Look for a handle with a horizontal grip for the thumb and clearance for the fingers. Your handle should stay cool, especially when pouring. Its grip design should be comfy and encourage a confident, accurate pour. STABLE POT. Your Press should be stable enough to resist accidental tipping when struck: A Press can have tall proportions IF the weight is substantial. A base smaller that the width at any point is not a good design. DRIPLESS SPOUT. Your French Press should never drip or dribble when pouring...return it if it does so. Good design prevents that. SAFE TO USE. Your Press must be safe to use when not fully awake in the morning. As you know, accidents and fumbles can happen, so avoid materials that might shatter, crack, or injure you, as well as needing replacement. Only foodgrade 18/5 or the better 18/10 stainless steel should be used. Glass beakers should be highheat resistant, Pyrex type borosilicate glass. If plastics are used, ensure that they are foodsafe, BPAfree, and are not porous enough to harbor bacteria (or harbor stale coffee tastes and aromas). If ceramics are used, ensure that the glazes are food safe, cadmium and cobaltfree, or FDA approved. MATCHING YOUR FRENCH PRESS SIZE TO YOUR DESIRED COFFEE SERVING SIZEBUY THE RIGHT SIZE FOR YOUR DESIRED SERVING SIZE : When brewing fill the press no higher than an inch or more from the brim, or to the V at the bottom of the spout. This reduces capacity, but prevents coffee ejecting from the spout when pressing down. Room MUST be allowed for the halfinch to oneinch thick CO2 caused foamy \"bloom\" to rise, the water displacement of the plunger and spillage room. Do not forget the volume of the grounds either, and the 24 ounces of water retained by the grounds after pouring. Because of the facts mentioned above, any \"tothebrim\" capacity claimed by the maker must be adjusted downward by at least 26 fl. oz., in proportion to the size of the press. This goes for ALL brands and models of French Press products. For example, Frieling's stated capacities are often confusing and not clearly defined, so you might need to contact Freiling to ask questions prior to purchase, or read the below. Do so when shopping Bodum, BonJour, Frieling, or any brand of French Press. To eliminate confusion, you need to know the actual, always lesser, YIELD of served coffee in fluid ounces, not the maximum capacity, to the brim, of the French Presses you are comparing. If in doubt, go larger. A REVIEW OF THE FRIELING FRENCH PRESSPROS:1) FRIELING OWNERS ON AMAZON VOTE IT AN AVERAGE OF 4.7 STARS, 94% POSITIVE. You might have noticed that few products on Amazon are rated that highly.2) FRIELING MAKES FIVE SIZES FOR YOUR DESIRED PORTION SIZE. Frieling's stated sizes are at full capacity, but it is prudent to reduce that maximum capacity by about 26 fluid ounces, depending upon the size chosen, to allow space for the plunger and the inevitable rising head of bloomfoam when hot water hits the ground coffee. Accordingly, Frieling makes FIVE sizes to suit your capacity needs: 8 fl/oz, 16 fl/oz, 23 fl/oz, 36 fl/oz, and 44 fl/oz.3) DOUBLEWALL THERMAL INSULATION. Frieling makes only one model, the Ultimo, in polished or brushed finish. ALL its three main elements are hollow, doublewall insulated: the pot, the handle, AND the lid. So far, it is the only brand or model of French Press, with one exception, to possesses ALL three featuresthe insulated LID in particular. Such insulation will keep your brewing coffee at 195205 degrees F during the entire brewing cycle resulting in maximum flavor and aroma, as verified by the Specialty Coffee Association of America. FrielingUSA states that such insulation retains heat four times longer than a glass French press.4) 18/10 STAINLESS, COMMERCIALGRADE DURABILITY. Unique to Frieling, this heavy duty French Press is made of food grade, foodsafe solid stainless steel, 18/10 (18% chromium, 10% nickel: best quality), heavy gauge stainless steel stock. This quality, special alloy is foodsafe and leadfree, meant for commercial use in hotel roomservice and hotel dining rooms, for finecuisine restaurants, for caterers, and is sold to specialty, highend hotel/restaurant supply houses (still Frieling's primary business). Such high quality steel NEVER rusts or stains, and I mean NEVER. Also, it will never shatter or injure you. Survives dishwasher hell, and comes out looking like new. The Frieling was once under the radar. It is now available to the public at better coffeeware or kitchenware stores, and is available here on Amazon, far from its industrial roots. The interior is brushed, and because the stainless walls are solid all the way through, the plunger cannot scratch off any \"coating\" because there is no coating...so nothing can rust...as so many other reviewers here have confirmed. Neither the high speed metal brushed finish nor the mirror finish will affect its nonrust qualities...it is just a cosmetic thing.5) ITS FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION. Discipline and restraint, with utility in mind, results in the Frieling's handsome, elegant, and understated lines. Appearance has been given a slight nod. It's all business. Even its high polish is not there to WOW at, but to make it easier to clean. There are no false touches present; only the authentic remains. The entire achievement makes it presentable for casual entertaining, even for more formal occasions. A matching sugar and creamer, with spoon, is available. Its tall, slightly narrow profile has a small footprint, taking up little space on the counter or the table. Shopper's note: Confusing an insulated Press with an insulated carafe is a very common blunder. ANY brand of thermal insulated French Press is specifically designed as a brewer, NOT as a thermal carafe or thermos, so brewed coffee MUST be poured into cups IMMEDIATELY after the four minute brewing period or the continued steeping will produce, even if over a minute, an overextracted, bitter, and insipid cup! For leftover coffee, use a preheated thermal carafe or thermos, with a screwon sealed lid, specifically designed to store hot coffee, and to keep it hot, after it is brewed. Actually, it is best not to store coffee. Consume coffee within 1015 minutes for the best flavor. For more coffee simply brew more coffee for the best flavor.6) THE POT'S SMALL SPOUT is dripless due to its lipped design. Not a stray drop on the tablecloth yet after four years of daily use. The spout is small enough to lose minimal heat, and I tested the heat loss by plugging the spout with window pane putty and measured only a one degree F heat loss compared to an open spout when brewing. It therefore needs no mechanism to close the spout. You will discover that the spout is large enough for a quick, steepstopping pour.7) THE INSULATED LID is entirely unique. It is, with one exception, the only INSULATED lid for a French Press to be found by any manufacturer. Heat rises, and as far as heat is concerned, the pot functions as a chimney, focusing heat above, and its opening is where most heat is lost. This lid caps the heat with its tight fit and insulation. The lid's underside dome shape helps assist in that, like a domed teakettle. The overall lid design is critical if you care to brew at the proper 195205 degree F temperature. THIS WAS THE FINAL KICKER IN MY DECISION TO CHOOSE THE FRIELING, along with the other goodies.8) THE INSULATED HANDLE is crafted of hollow, extruded stainless, all of a piece, to keep it cool, as well as to keep it llight weight so as not to unsteady the pot. The handle's vertical upright is ovoid in crosssection to provide comfort for the gripping fingers. A secure niche for the thumb is provided with its horizontal thumb rest and thumbblock. An often overlooked feature in cup or French Press design, because if the thumb rests on on a horizontal support, especially if that support is provided with a means of blocking the thumb from slipping off, one's grip is then very secure indeed. Take a look at the photo of the handle on this site, you'll see it. The long, vertical provides plenty of clearance for the fingers, and is angled inward toward the bottom to secure the fingers, also to provide good leverage when pouring.9) THE PLUNGER, when pushed down, results in a dynamic turbulence that agitates the water and grounds to intensify flavors...this is the heart of the Press, and what makes French Press what it is. It also separates the grounds from the coffee, so it is fitted to precise specifications to minimize stray grounds coming through the filter or from between the pot's inner walls and the periphery of the plunger, and thence into the cup. The unit is entirely crafted from 18/10 stainless steel (the best grade)...no plastic parts to retain stale tastes whatsoever. Easy to dissemble for cleaning and spare parts are always available. Remember, with ANY French Press you will have stray grounds, especially if you buy canned coffee because it is always ground too fine for French Press, or if you use anything but a burr grinder. Even so, tiny grounds sneak in...French Pressists never sip that last sip: don't blame the Frieling Press, or a Bodum, or a BonJour.10) REPLACEMENT PARTS AND EXCHANGES FOR VALID PROBLEMS ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE. My online and telephone experience with Frieling USA has been excellent. They will replace any product or part you feel is defective. Also, down the line, parts such as the filter screen. cross plate, spiral plate of the plunger assembly, or the plunger rod, are available at very reasonable prices.11) FRIELING KEEPS GOOD COMPANY. Beside Amazon, the finest, most prestigious online coffee gear retailers carry it: cateringplanet, wholelattelove, seattlecoffeegear, clivecoffee, terroircoffee, williamssonoma, espressozone, shop. illy, chriscoffee, liquidplanet, roaste, crateandbarrel, coffee. become, coffeebydesign, coffeeart, veniacoffee, greentreecoffee, blacksmithcoffee, wayfair, etc.12) USEFUL FOR MAKING \"OPEN POT\" COFFEE. You can also use this for \"OPEN POT\" brewing, the simple, \"connoisseur's method,\" also called \"Cowboy Coffee.\" With this method, you simply dose a pot with coffee, pour in offboil water, and steep with the lid on, but with the plunger extended just, stir three times during the steep, after the four minute steep pour through a fine filter into your cup. The flavor is similar to French Pressed coffee.13) USEFUL AS AN INSULATED SERVING PITCHER FOR HOT OR COLD DRINKS. Use the Freiling for serving cold juices, milk, or ice water; use it for serving hot syrup, hot chocolate, hot milk, etc.14) EASY TO CLEAN. The Freiling is dishwasher safe and that will remove any water spots or fingerprints with ease. The plunger filter assembly does not need to be taken apart to clean. Handwashing is often used when camping. Coffee oils build up on grinders and coffee makers of any kind...same here. So, periodically, when you see a thin brown film, use a watervinegar solution and let soak overnight, then scrub well. CONS:1) THE LID CAN SLIP FORWARD A BIT WHEN POURING: The lid is snug for pressing, but while pouring, the lid can slip forward a half inch or so. Solutionthe \"teapot pour\", the way waitstaff use it: with the finger(s) of one hand, lightly press down on the lid, the other hand grips the handle to pour. Or, use the \"onehand pour\": grip the handle with your fingers, press down lightly with side of your thumb upon the flat of the lid's back edge, or use the index finger as another reviewer here mentioned, then pour...easy and secure. If you are extremely heatsensitive just use a potholder to hold to lid. I never need to, and neither do my Frieling French Press using friends, including my daughter.2) A FEW SMALL PARTICLES OF GRIND CAN CATCH IN THE PLUNGER, in the tiny screen seam. SolutionIf that happens, then after brewing and rinsing out your Frieling, fill with hot water, replace lid and plunger. Then, pumping vigorously up and down a few times, the turbulence removes the particles. I seldom have to do that twice or use a small brush. Then place the pot and plunger in the dishwasher.3) FRIELING'S SIZING IS CONFUSING CUSTOMERS: Capacities of Frieling's presses are often expressed in two capacities: he \"serving\" capacity and the \"maximum capacity\" when used as a serving carafe for liquids other than coffee. Very often the \"serving capacity\" is not accurate, serving less than the amount stated. Moreover, various vendors, Amazon sellers, and other retailers list the same model at different capacities. It is maddening. Not only that, but most customers do not know that the \"cups\" Frieling and all coffee manufacturers refer to are actually the European \"Tasse\" cup of 4.22 fluid oz each (1/8 liter, 125ml), NOT the US 8oz measuring cup, so customers often feel misinformed when coffee servings are HALF what they expected. Frieling is innocent of misrepresentation here: it is customer ignorance that is at fault. Regardless, Frieling needs to address this issue ASAP and give us the ACTUAL YIELD per serving, in US fluid ounces, of each size offered. CONCLUSIONThe Frieling French presses are a commercial, industrial design with commercialgrade stainless, insulated everywhere, including the lid, easier to clean than with plastic parts that also retain flavors. Holds the brew temperature at the correct SCAA recommended 195205 degrees, the most important brewing feature of all. Dishwasher hardy and cleanup is easy. Handsome and presentable for entertaining. Durable to the maximum. Excellent, all stainless plunger, few stray particles, produces minimal silt. Highly recommended. 4.8 Amazon stars.

LA CAFETIERE THERMIQUE 8c, $35, 4.2 stars: NO plastics, INSULATED LID, drips, MIXED REVIEWS, stable. P.S. Most of the above brands and models, Bodum and BonJour in particular, I respect for their overall quality, if not for the plastic parts. They, and Frieling, all make similar coffee, but with varying degrees of insulation efficiency and thus very noticeable flavorintensity outcomes. Being consumergrade products, they are not expected to be as durable as commercialgrade equivalents, such as Frieling, due to their intended work environment. Consequently, their comparison with the Frieling is a bit unfair...like comparing apples to oranges. Always buy commercial products whenever possible...the tough guys. By the way, if you remain loyal to glassbeakered Presses, the doubleglass wall, insulated version of the iconic Bodum Chambord 8c ($80) is available (being that glass holds in heat better than metal, I can recommend it), but a replacement beaker is $50, $130 total Amazon. If insulation is not important to you, the glass beakered, single walled, Bodum Eileen ($67 Amazon for the 8c), with its \"full metal perforated jacket\" of stainless, is widely used in French restaurants and bistros as a commercial Press; it is fairly durable for a single wall Press due to the metal sheath, but its single wall will NOT keep the brew at the right temperature. A REBUTTAL OF THE MOST COMMON CRITICAL REVIEWS, AND SOME OVER THE TOP ONESTHE COMMON ONES1) \"Some grounds and silt bypass the filter and are in my cup.\" Answer: some will always pass through, it is a French Press thing, common to all brands and models...French Pressists never take that last sip. But there are three ways to dramatically reduce that, 1) the fault, almost invariably, USING A WHIRLYBLADE GRINDER, or the LACK OF A CONICAL BURR GRINDER that allows you to grind EVENLY and COARSELY, no more dustandboulders; or b) not grinding COARSELY enough with any grinder; or c) buying CANNED OR PACKAGED PREGROUND coffee ground FINE for drip coffee so that fine grounds can bypass the French Press's filter. Grind mediumcourse for French Press, not\" fine. If you have no good grinder then have your coffee source grind it coarsely for you.2) \"My coffee does not stay hot very long after I pour it.\" Answer: ANY brand of French Press is designed to BREW coffee, and NOT TO STORE IT. Period. Stainless Steel, or glass, doublewalled Presses are designed to keep the brewing coffee at the correct temperature (195205 degrees) DURING THE BREW CYCLE and are NOT MEANT TO STORE COFFEE AFTER THE BREW CYCLE IS COMPLETED. If the steep goes much past 4 minutes you get nasty coffeeoverextracted and bitter. I am convinced that the confusion comes from mistaking what it looks like: an insulated pot \"looks\" like a thermos, or insulated carafe. Well, it's not. It's a brewer. Timing is critical when making any coffee. Espresso Baristas use a timer to cut short their pull at 2530 seconds per shot, with French Press (and drip) set your timer to 3.5 to 4.5 minutes per extraction (4 minutes is the sweet spot).3)\"I get this metallic taste (or bitter taste, or stale taste, take your pick).\" Stainless steel, especially foodgrade 18/10 stainless used in the Frieling, is famed for imparting ZERO taste to food or beverages. It's what it's known for. The offtastes come from other sources such as, a) coffeol oil and collagen residues adhering to the Press wall, or in your grinder, or both...keep them clean, or 2) certain coffees give off unusual flavor notes also, or c) your water might be less than ideal, or d) your dishwash detergent is not thoroughly rinsed off. It's NOT the metal itself. THE OVERTHETOP ONES\"The handle breaks off,\" or \"has a sloppy weld.\" Or, \"Cannot clean the thing at all.\" Or, \"I get gray powder on my paper towel when I wipe it out.\" Answer: These are over the top, spoiler, dealkilling statements and are intended to be so, for various malicious reasons, I remain convinced, and so utterly lacking in truth that they are laughable. The laserweld on the handle is so secure that the restaurant supply managers I personally know say they have never experienced any handle failures or sloppy welds, none, ever. Dirty Stainless is not 18/10 stainless's fault, so if really neglected use foodservice's favorite: Barkeeper's Friend, use it gently, rinse. Lastly...\"It shows fingerprints all the time, and spots\"...uh, well, wipe them off, how hard is that? Or sell it on ebay and buy the new matte brushedfinish Frieling. Gray powder on the inside? Not possible with 18/10 Stainless...has to be bad water or bad dishwashing detergent, come on, think of a better pot shot. Frieling's positive 4 & 5 star reviews are 94% of the total here. That is highly unusual on Amazon. So don't worry, the $75 is only about $10 more than the lesser Bodums you might be shopping. It is money well spent, lasting for many, many years. I cherish my Frieling, and so will you. THE COFFEE HOUSE FRENCH PRESS BREW METHOD: The Hows and Whys USE CLEAN, COLD WATER. Brewing with a French Press is simple and easy. You have to know how to do it and WHY you are doing it to extract the most flavor possible. Essentially, your water flavor must be good so you begin by using cold, filtered water. You fill your kettle with TWICE the water needed: half to prewarm your Press and the other half for brewing. USE THE RIGHT DOSE OF COFFEE BEANS. Dose coffee beans at 5565g of coffee beans per liter of water, or 70 grams if you \"break and clean\" (rather than stirring the bloom, you break the bloom foam cake and spoon out the surface grounds to reduce the fines, in which case you sacrifice some brewing grounds, so you need to overdose a bit). Use a kitchen scale to measure. BEGIN GRINDING THE BEANS JUST BEFORE THE WATER BOILS. Once the bean husk is cracked open favor immediately escapes, so wait until the last minute to grind, just as the water begins to boil. BREW AT THE CORRECT TEMPERATURE. As the water almost boils, start your grinder, prewarm your Press with half the offboil water, empty the Press and fill with the grounds weighed on a scale. Then pour in the other half of the water, using a scale to measure, at about 205208 degrees F so as the temperature drops during the brew you are NEVER brewing lower than 195 degrees F. NEVER begin at 195 degrees F or flavor really suffers as the temp at brew's end can even drop to 185 degrees F...not good! BREW FOR THE CORRECT TIME. A fourminute brew cycle is highly recommended. Anything less gives you a raw, underextracted cup, anything more gives you an overcooked, overextracted, bitter cup. At Brew's end, ALWAYS pour out coffee into cups to terminate the brewing. NEVER store coffee in any coffee brewer as it will continue to brew! Even with drip brewing coffee is stored in a carafe...do that same here. A coffee brewer of any kind is NOT a coffee storage carafe. That is a job for a thermally insulated carafe. The insulation in a French Press is there to keep the brew at the correct temperature DURING the brew cycle. BREWING IT: An upclose look at brewing French Press Coffee1. FILL KETTLE with at least TWICE the water needed to brew. Use only fresh, neverboiled, COLD, FILTERED water, not the nasty tasting, mildly rusty hot water sitting inside your hot water heater. Now begin heating your water at high heat.2. WEIGH YOUR BEANS. While the water heats, place your grinder's groundscollecting bin on your scales, then tare to zero. After weighing, pour the beans into the grinder's hopper, then place the grounds bin in the grinder to catch the grounds when you grind.3. GRIND YOUR BEANS. Set your grinder to a mid coarse setting, as coarse as coarsely ground pepper, and experiment to get the dosage just right for your taste...I like the finer side of coarse. When your water almost boils, at about 210211 degrees F, turn off the heat and start your grinder and let the water temp drop a bit in the meantime.4. WEIGH WATER AS YOU POUR, THEN STEEP. While the grinder is grinding, pour hot water into your Press to warm it. When the grinding is completed, pour the warming water from the Press into your cup(s) to prewarm them, discard remaining water from the Press. Then pour your coffee grounds to the Press and place your Press on your scales, tare the Press to zero. To monitor heat place a thermometer in your Press. Now pour in the kettle's remaining 205208 degree F water into the Press as shown on your scale (I use 870900g in my 1 liter Press). Place the lid on the Press with plunger extended upward to begin the brewing cycle. Set your timer to 4 minutes.5. STIR, SINK, OR SCOOP OFF THE BLOOM. After after one minute, either gently stir, or sink the bloom with a spoon, or remove (break) the cake \"crust\" with a soup spoon (or two) to gently scoop to remove (clean) the bloom off the top to reduce the amount of fines in the brew. Be sure no grounds remain above the plunger or in the spout as those grounds will end up in your cup.6. REPLACE THE LID AND FINISH BREWING. With the lid on, continue to brew until the timer beeps, then press the plunger down VERY SLOWLY to the bottom (to reduce agitation of any fines present). Pour out the warming water from your cup(s), THEN pour in the hot coffee from the Press to replace it. Serve and enjoy. This is the ambrosia people are talking about...properly made French Press. Hoping to cover all the bases, and to eliminate any confusion, I have gone into great detail so you know not only HOW to properly make French Press, but also WHY you make it that way. Making French Press is actually a very simple ritual once you do it a few times, much simpler than it appears in the above. NOTE: The French Press pictured above is the highly regarded doublewalled insulated Frieling Ultimo French Press made of 100% 18/10 stainless steel with a stainless steel lid and parts..no plastic parts in the lid or filter plunger. The Frieling is a fine hotel and restaurant grade product available in five sizes. Available in mirror polished or brushed matte finishes.

      "\"One chews coffee beans while gargling 200 F water for four minutes; pressing with the tongue, coffee is filtered through the teeth: is this the French press you refer to?\"  M. PythonAN INTRODUCTION TO COFFEE AMBROSIA. It's a quest for flavor. It's all about flavor. You are here searching for the best quality French Press, one that delivers the most flavorful coffee possible. You might be new to French Press and are rightly skeptical about the vulnerability and safety of a glass model. Or, you might be experienced, a Bodum or BonJour refugee exasperated by having to replace your second, or third, or even your seventh broken glass beaker. No cuts? Lucky you. Been there. Below: First is a look at buying a French Press, followed by a Review of the Frieling French Press, then info on grinders, accessories, buying coffee, and brewing the best French Press. SHOPPING FOR A FRENCH PRESS: WHAT TO LOOK FORFIRST, WHAT IS FRENCH PRESS? Call it French Press, Press Pot, Cafetiere, Plunger Pot, Pressed Coffee, Coffee Press, or Cafe a Piston, it is all the same. Invented by an Italian man, popularized in France, \"French Press\" has emigrated to North America. The apparatus itself is strikingly simple: A handled pot, a lid, and a plunger. A French Press can be made of glass, metal, plastic, or ceramic. The pot is never placed on a stove burner...hot water is poured over ground coffee and steeped a few minutes, the plunger is pressed down, the brewed coffee is then poured into cups. French Press is a handson brewing method that allows the user to control brewing variables, adjusting for personal taste. This is a fullimmersion brewing method where the bed of grounds can steep, or soak, for a few minutes prior to pressing to terminate the brewing, thereby remarkably intensifying the brew's flavors and aromas when properly brewed using proper equipment. Usually, coarsely ground coffee beans are poured into the Press followed by offtheboil water, allowed to steep about four minutes at the correct temperature, then the pistonlike, porous filter plunger is slowly pressed down to filter and separate the grounds from the brewed coffee just prior to serving. A simple ritual indeed. In order to brew French Press you need a French Press. So, for shrewd shopping, French Press design features are discussed below...SIMPLICITY. No unnecessary parts means less parts to fail or to clean. ROBUST CONSTRUCTION: Your pot,lid and plunger should be of sturdy, durable construction using rustfree metals such as foodgrade stainless steel, high impact, BPAfree plastics, borosilicate glass, or quality ceramics with foodsafe glazes. The most durable, heavyduty quality is heavyduty restaurant/hotel commercial grade rather than the far less durable, lightduty consumer grade. INSULATION: Coffee Science has confirmed that coffee should be brewed at between 195 and 205 degrees F during the ENTIRE brewing cycle to release as much flavor and aroma as possible. The brewing cycle is usually four minutes for French Press. To keep temperatures within this range during the brewing cycle requires an INSULATED French Press. French Press designs that will do so are: thermal doublewall stainless or glass, thickwall ceramic designs, or inexpensive \"thermos\" designs. A heads up: An INSULATED French Press is a dedicated coffee BREWER, and is NOT a coffee storage vessel designed to store coffee after brewing...therefore it should NOT be confused with an INSULATED \"thermos,\" a design dedicated only to STORING hot or cold beverages. So, after brewing, immediately pour ALL coffee into cups or into an insulated thermos. This will immediately terminate brewing to avoid overextraction, producing a bitter cup. DISHWASHER SAFE. Ensure that your Press is dishwasher safe, and is easy to clean if handwashed. Look for hidden corners or crevices. Insist on dishwasher safe highheat resistant materials. EFFECTIVE FILTER. Your plunger's filter screen, the metal mesh, must filter, or separate, coffee grounds from the brewed coffee. The finer the screen the better it does so, BUT, and I mean the BIG BUT...no matter how good your grinder is, or your filter, some very fine particles will always make it through the filter, ending up at the bottom of your cup. It cannot be helped. Why?Because if the screen is too fine, almost solid, all grounds might be filtered out, but then it might be impossible to push the plunger to the bottom because of the resistance encountered when coffee cannot pass through the filter, yet if the filter screen is too porous then the amount of \"fines\" coming through the filter screen will markedly increase. The solution?Aside from optimal filter porosity, a quality burr grinder is key in reducing to a minimum the amount of \"fines\" coming into your cup. Even still, do not take the last sip...a bit of silt in the cup is a French Press thing...part of its reality, part of its pleasure...the price you pay for excellence in the cup. COMFORTABLE, SECURE HANDLE. You need a comfortable, secure, insulated handle. Look for a handle with a horizontal grip for the thumb and clearance for the fingers. Your handle should stay cool, especially when pouring. Its grip design should be comfy and encourage a confident, accurate pour. STABLE POT. Your Press should be stable enough to resist accidental tipping when struck: A Press can have tall proportions IF the weight is substantial. A base smaller that the width at any point is not a good design. DRIPLESS SPOUT. Your French Press should never drip or dribble when pouring...return it if it does so. Good design prevents that. SAFE TO USE. Your Press must be safe to use when not fully awake in the morning. As you know, accidents and fumbles can happen, so avoid materials that might shatter, crack, or injure you, as well as needing replacement. Only foodgrade 18/5 or the better 18/10 stainless steel should be used. Glass beakers should be highheat resistant, Pyrex type borosilicate glass. If plastics are used, ensure that they are foodsafe, BPAfree, and are not porous enough to harbor bacteria (or harbor stale coffee tastes and aromas). If ceramics are used, ensure that the glazes are food safe, cadmium and cobaltfree, or FDA approved. MATCHING YOUR FRENCH PRESS SIZE TO YOUR DESIRED COFFEE SERVING SIZEBUY THE RIGHT SIZE FOR YOUR DESIRED SERVING SIZE : When brewing fill the press no higher than an inch or more from the brim, or to the V at the bottom of the spout. This reduces capacity, but prevents coffee ejecting from the spout when pressing down. Room MUST be allowed for the halfinch to oneinch thick CO2 caused foamy \"bloom\" to rise, the water displacement of the plunger and spillage room. Do not forget the volume of the grounds either, and the 24 ounces of water retained by the grounds after pouring. Because of the facts mentioned above, any \"tothebrim\" capacity claimed by the maker must be adjusted downward by at least 26 fl. oz., in proportion to the size of the press. This goes for ALL brands and models of French Press products. For example, Frieling's stated capacities are often confusing and not clearly defined, so you might need to contact Freiling to ask questions prior to purchase, or read the below. Do so when shopping Bodum, BonJour, Frieling, or any brand of French Press. To eliminate confusion, you need to know the actual, always lesser, YIELD of served coffee in fluid ounces, not the maximum capacity, to the brim, of the French Presses you are comparing. If in doubt, go larger. A REVIEW OF THE FRIELING FRENCH PRESSPROS:1) FRIELING OWNERS ON AMAZON VOTE IT AN AVERAGE OF 4.7 STARS, 94% POSITIVE. You might have noticed that few products on Amazon are rated that highly.2) FRIELING MAKES FIVE SIZES FOR YOUR DESIRED PORTION SIZE. Frieling's stated sizes are at full capacity, but it is prudent to reduce that maximum capacity by about 26 fluid ounces, depending upon the size chosen, to allow space for the plunger and the inevitable rising head of bloomfoam when hot water hits the ground coffee. Accordingly, Frieling makes FIVE sizes to suit your capacity needs: 8 fl/oz, 16 fl/oz, 23 fl/oz, 36 fl/oz, and 44 fl/oz.3) DOUBLEWALL THERMAL INSULATION. Frieling makes only one model, the Ultimo, in polished or brushed finish. ALL its three main elements are hollow, doublewall insulated: the pot, the handle, AND the lid. So far, it is the only brand or model of French Press, with one exception, to possesses ALL three featuresthe insulated LID in particular. Such insulation will keep your brewing coffee at 195205 degrees F during the entire brewing cycle resulting in maximum flavor and aroma, as verified by the Specialty Coffee Association of America. FrielingUSA states that such insulation retains heat four times longer than a glass French press.4) 18/10 STAINLESS, COMMERCIALGRADE DURABILITY. Unique to Frieling, this heavy duty French Press is made of food grade, foodsafe solid stainless steel, 18/10 (18% chromium, 10% nickel: best quality), heavy gauge stainless steel stock. This quality, special alloy is foodsafe and leadfree, meant for commercial use in hotel roomservice and hotel dining rooms, for finecuisine restaurants, for caterers, and is sold to specialty, highend hotel/restaurant supply houses (still Frieling's primary business). Such high quality steel NEVER rusts or stains, and I mean NEVER. Also, it will never shatter or injure you. Survives dishwasher hell, and comes out looking like new. The Frieling was once under the radar. It is now available to the public at better coffeeware or kitchenware stores, and is available here on Amazon, far from its industrial roots. The interior is brushed, and because the stainless walls are solid all the way through, the plunger cannot scratch off any \"coating\" because there is no coating...so nothing can rust...as so many other reviewers here have confirmed. Neither the high speed metal brushed finish nor the mirror finish will affect its nonrust qualities...it is just a cosmetic thing.5) ITS FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION. Discipline and restraint, with utility in mind, results in the Frieling's handsome, elegant, and understated lines. Appearance has been given a slight nod. It's all business. Even its high polish is not there to WOW at, but to make it easier to clean. There are no false touches present; only the authentic remains. The entire achievement makes it presentable for casual entertaining, even for more formal occasions. A matching sugar and creamer, with spoon, is available. Its tall, slightly narrow profile has a small footprint, taking up little space on the counter or the table. Shopper's note: Confusing an insulated Press with an insulated carafe is a very common blunder. ANY brand of thermal insulated French Press is specifically designed as a brewer, NOT as a thermal carafe or thermos, so brewed coffee MUST be poured into cups IMMEDIATELY after the four minute brewing period or the continued steeping will produce, even if over a minute, an overextracted, bitter, and insipid cup! For leftover coffee, use a preheated thermal carafe or thermos, with a screwon sealed lid, specifically designed to store hot coffee, and to keep it hot, after it is brewed. Actually, it is best not to store coffee. Consume coffee within 1015 minutes for the best flavor. For more coffee simply brew more coffee for the best flavor.6) THE POT'S SMALL SPOUT is dripless due to its lipped design. Not a stray drop on the tablecloth yet after four years of daily use. The spout is small enough to lose minimal heat, and I tested the heat loss by plugging the spout with window pane putty and measured only a one degree F heat loss compared to an open spout when brewing. It therefore needs no mechanism to close the spout. You will discover that the spout is large enough for a quick, steepstopping pour.7) THE INSULATED LID is entirely unique. It is, with one exception, the only INSULATED lid for a French Press to be found by any manufacturer. Heat rises, and as far as heat is concerned, the pot functions as a chimney, focusing heat above, and its opening is where most heat is lost. This lid caps the heat with its tight fit and insulation. The lid's underside dome shape helps assist in that, like a domed teakettle. The overall lid design is critical if you care to brew at the proper 195205 degree F temperature. THIS WAS THE FINAL KICKER IN MY DECISION TO CHOOSE THE FRIELING, along with the other goodies.8) THE INSULATED HANDLE is crafted of hollow, extruded stainless, all of a piece, to keep it cool, as well as to keep it llight weight so as not to unsteady the pot. The handle's vertical upright is ovoid in crosssection to provide comfort for the gripping fingers. A secure niche for the thumb is provided with its horizontal thumb rest and thumbblock. An often overlooked feature in cup or French Press design, because if the thumb rests on on a horizontal support, especially if that support is provided with a means of blocking the thumb from slipping off, one's grip is then very secure indeed. Take a look at the photo of the handle on this site, you'll see it. The long, vertical provides plenty of clearance for the fingers, and is angled inward toward the bottom to secure the fingers, also to provide good leverage when pouring.9) THE PLUNGER, when pushed down, results in a dynamic turbulence that agitates the water and grounds to intensify flavors...this is the heart of the Press, and what makes French Press what it is. It also separates the grounds from the coffee, so it is fitted to precise specifications to minimize stray grounds coming through the filter or from between the pot's inner walls and the periphery of the plunger, and thence into the cup. The unit is entirely crafted from 18/10 stainless steel (the best grade)...no plastic parts to retain stale tastes whatsoever. Easy to dissemble for cleaning and spare parts are always available. Remember, with ANY French Press you will have stray grounds, especially if you buy canned coffee because it is always ground too fine for French Press, or if you use anything but a burr grinder. Even so, tiny grounds sneak in...French Pressists never sip that last sip: don't blame the Frieling Press, or a Bodum, or a BonJour.10) REPLACEMENT PARTS AND EXCHANGES FOR VALID PROBLEMS ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE. My online and telephone experience with Frieling USA has been excellent. They will replace any product or part you feel is defective. Also, down the line, parts such as the filter screen. cross plate, spiral plate of the plunger assembly, or the plunger rod, are available at very reasonable prices.11) FRIELING KEEPS GOOD COMPANY. Beside Amazon, the finest, most prestigious online coffee gear retailers carry it: cateringplanet, wholelattelove, seattlecoffeegear, clivecoffee, terroircoffee, williamssonoma, espressozone, shop. illy, chriscoffee, liquidplanet, roaste, crateandbarrel, coffee. become, coffeebydesign, coffeeart, veniacoffee, greentreecoffee, blacksmithcoffee, wayfair, etc.12) USEFUL FOR MAKING \"OPEN POT\" COFFEE. You can also use this for \"OPEN POT\" brewing, the simple, \"connoisseur's method,\" also called \"Cowboy Coffee.\" With this method, you simply dose a pot with coffee, pour in offboil water, and steep with the lid on, but with the plunger extended just, stir three times during the steep, after the four minute steep pour through a fine filter into your cup. The flavor is similar to French Pressed coffee.13) USEFUL AS AN INSULATED SERVING PITCHER FOR HOT OR COLD DRINKS. Use the Freiling for serving cold juices, milk, or ice water; use it for serving hot syrup, hot chocolate, hot milk, etc.14) EASY TO CLEAN. The Freiling is dishwasher safe and that will remove any water spots or fingerprints with ease. The plunger filter assembly does not need to be taken apart to clean. Handwashing is often used when camping. Coffee oils build up on grinders and coffee makers of any kind...same here. So, periodically, when you see a thin brown film, use a watervinegar solution and let soak overnight, then scrub well. CONS:1) THE LID CAN SLIP FORWARD A BIT WHEN POURING: The lid is snug for pressing, but while pouring, the lid can slip forward a half inch or so. Solutionthe \"teapot pour\", the way waitstaff use it: with the finger(s) of one hand, lightly press down on the lid, the other hand grips the handle to pour. Or, use the \"onehand pour\": grip the handle with your fingers, press down lightly with side of your thumb upon the flat of the lid's back edge, or use the index finger as another reviewer here mentioned, then pour...easy and secure. If you are extremely heatsensitive just use a potholder to hold to lid. I never need to, and neither do my Frieling French Press using friends, including my daughter.2) A FEW SMALL PARTICLES OF GRIND CAN CATCH IN THE PLUNGER, in the tiny screen seam. SolutionIf that happens, then after brewing and rinsing out your Frieling, fill with hot water, replace lid and plunger. Then, pumping vigorously up and down a few times, the turbulence removes the particles. I seldom have to do that twice or use a small brush. Then place the pot and plunger in the dishwasher.3) FRIELING'S SIZING IS CONFUSING CUSTOMERS: Capacities of Frieling's presses are often expressed in two capacities: he \"serving\" capacity and the \"maximum capacity\" when used as a serving carafe for liquids other than coffee. Very often the \"serving capacity\" is not accurate, serving less than the amount stated. Moreover, various vendors, Amazon sellers, and other retailers list the same model at different capacities. It is maddening. Not only that, but most customers do not know that the \"cups\" Frieling and all coffee manufacturers refer to are actually the European \"Tasse\" cup of 4.22 fluid oz each (1/8 liter, 125ml), NOT the US 8oz measuring cup, so customers often feel misinformed when coffee servings are HALF what they expected. Frieling is innocent of misrepresentation here: it is customer ignorance that is at fault. Regardless, Frieling needs to address this issue ASAP and give us the ACTUAL YIELD per serving, in US fluid ounces, of each size offered. CONCLUSIONThe Frieling French presses are a commercial, industrial design with commercialgrade stainless, insulated everywhere, including the lid, easier to clean than with plastic parts that also retain flavors. Holds the brew temperature at the correct SCAA recommended 195205 degrees, the most important brewing feature of all. Dishwasher hardy and cleanup is easy. Handsome and presentable for entertaining. Durable to the maximum. Excellent, all stainless plunger, few stray particles, produces minimal silt. Highly recommended. 4.8 Amazon stars.

LA CAFETIERE THERMIQUE 8c, $35, 4.2 stars: NO plastics, INSULATED LID, drips, MIXED REVIEWS, stable. P.S. Most of the above brands and models, Bodum and BonJour in particular, I respect for their overall quality, if not for the plastic parts. They, and Frieling, all make similar coffee, but with varying degrees of insulation efficiency and thus very noticeable flavorintensity outcomes. Being consumergrade products, they are not expected to be as durable as commercialgrade equivalents, such as Frieling, due to their intended work environment. Consequently, their comparison with the Frieling is a bit unfair...like comparing apples to oranges. Always buy commercial products whenever possible...the tough guys. By the way, if you remain loyal to glassbeakered Presses, the doubleglass wall, insulated version of the iconic Bodum Chambord 8c ($80) is available (being that glass holds in heat better than metal, I can recommend it), but a replacement beaker is $50, $130 total Amazon. If insulation is not important to you, the glass beakered, single walled, Bodum Eileen ($67 Amazon for the 8c), with its \"full metal perforated jacket\" of stainless, is widely used in French restaurants and bistros as a commercial Press; it is fairly durable for a single wall Press due to the metal sheath, but its single wall will NOT keep the brew at the right temperature. A REBUTTAL OF THE MOST COMMON CRITICAL REVIEWS, AND SOME OVER THE TOP ONESTHE COMMON ONES1) \"Some grounds and silt bypass the filter and are in my cup.\" Answer: some will always pass through, it is a French Press thing, common to all brands and models...French Pressists never take that last sip. But there are three ways to dramatically reduce that, 1) the fault, almost invariably, USING A WHIRLYBLADE GRINDER, or the LACK OF A CONICAL BURR GRINDER that allows you to grind EVENLY and COARSELY, no more dustandboulders; or b) not grinding COARSELY enough with any grinder; or c) buying CANNED OR PACKAGED PREGROUND coffee ground FINE for drip coffee so that fine grounds can bypass the French Press's filter. Grind mediumcourse for French Press, not\" fine. If you have no good grinder then have your coffee source grind it coarsely for you.2) \"My coffee does not stay hot very long after I pour it.\" Answer: ANY brand of French Press is designed to BREW coffee, and NOT TO STORE IT. Period. Stainless Steel, or glass, doublewalled Presses are designed to keep the brewing coffee at the correct temperature (195205 degrees) DURING THE BREW CYCLE and are NOT MEANT TO STORE COFFEE AFTER THE BREW CYCLE IS COMPLETED. If the steep goes much past 4 minutes you get nasty coffeeoverextracted and bitter. I am convinced that the confusion comes from mistaking what it looks like: an insulated pot \"looks\" like a thermos, or insulated carafe. Well, it's not. It's a brewer. Timing is critical when making any coffee. Espresso Baristas use a timer to cut short their pull at 2530 seconds per shot, with French Press (and drip) set your timer to 3.5 to 4.5 minutes per extraction (4 minutes is the sweet spot).3)\"I get this metallic taste (or bitter taste, or stale taste, take your pick).\" Stainless steel, especially foodgrade 18/10 stainless used in the Frieling, is famed for imparting ZERO taste to food or beverages. It's what it's known for. The offtastes come from other sources such as, a) coffeol oil and collagen residues adhering to the Press wall, or in your grinder, or both...keep them clean, or 2) certain coffees give off unusual flavor notes also, or c) your water might be less than ideal, or d) your dishwash detergent is not thoroughly rinsed off. It's NOT the metal itself. THE OVERTHETOP ONES\"The handle breaks off,\" or \"has a sloppy weld.\" Or, \"Cannot clean the thing at all.\" Or, \"I get gray powder on my paper towel when I wipe it out.\" Answer: These are over the top, spoiler, dealkilling statements and are intended to be so, for various malicious reasons, I remain convinced, and so utterly lacking in truth that they are laughable. The laserweld on the handle is so secure that the restaurant supply managers I personally know say they have never experienced any handle failures or sloppy welds, none, ever. Dirty Stainless is not 18/10 stainless's fault, so if really neglected use foodservice's favorite: Barkeeper's Friend, use it gently, rinse. Lastly...\"It shows fingerprints all the time, and spots\"...uh, well, wipe them off, how hard is that? Or sell it on ebay and buy the new matte brushedfinish Frieling. Gray powder on the inside? Not possible with 18/10 Stainless...has to be bad water or bad dishwashing detergent, come on, think of a better pot shot. Frieling's positive 4 & 5 star reviews are 94% of the total here. That is highly unusual on Amazon. So don't worry, the $75 is only about $10 more than the lesser Bodums you might be shopping. It is money well spent, lasting for many, many years. I cherish my Frieling, and so will you. THE COFFEE HOUSE FRENCH PRESS BREW METHOD: The Hows and Whys USE CLEAN, COLD WATER. Brewing with a French Press is simple and easy. You have to know how to do it and WHY you are doing it to extract the most flavor possible. Essentially, your water flavor must be good so you begin by using cold, filtered water. You fill your kettle with TWICE the water needed: half to prewarm your Press and the other half for brewing. USE THE RIGHT DOSE OF COFFEE BEANS. Dose coffee beans at 5565g of coffee beans per liter of water, or 70 grams if you \"break and clean\" (rather than stirring the bloom, you break the bloom foam cake and spoon out the surface grounds to reduce the fines, in which case you sacrifice some brewing grounds, so you need to overdose a bit). Use a kitchen scale to measure. BEGIN GRINDING THE BEANS JUST BEFORE THE WATER BOILS. Once the bean husk is cracked open favor immediately escapes, so wait until the last minute to grind, just as the water begins to boil. BREW AT THE CORRECT TEMPERATURE. As the water almost boils, start your grinder, prewarm your Press with half the offboil water, empty the Press and fill with the grounds weighed on a scale. Then pour in the other half of the water, using a scale to measure, at about 205208 degrees F so as the temperature drops during the brew you are NEVER brewing lower than 195 degrees F. NEVER begin at 195 degrees F or flavor really suffers as the temp at brew's end can even drop to 185 degrees F...not good! BREW FOR THE CORRECT TIME. A fourminute brew cycle is highly recommended. Anything less gives you a raw, underextracted cup, anything more gives you an overcooked, overextracted, bitter cup. At Brew's end, ALWAYS pour out coffee into cups to terminate the brewing. NEVER store coffee in any coffee brewer as it will continue to brew! Even with drip brewing coffee is stored in a carafe...do that same here. A coffee brewer of any kind is NOT a coffee storage carafe. That is a job for a thermally insulated carafe. The insulation in a French Press is there to keep the brew at the correct temperature DURING the brew cycle. BREWING IT: An upclose look at brewing French Press Coffee1. FILL KETTLE with at least TWICE the water needed to brew. Use only fresh, neverboiled, COLD, FILTERED water, not the nasty tasting, mildly rusty hot water sitting inside your hot water heater. Now begin heating your water at high heat.2. WEIGH YOUR BEANS. While the water heats, place your grinder's groundscollecting bin on your scales, then tare to zero. After weighing, pour the beans into the grinder's hopper, then place the grounds bin in the grinder to catch the grounds when you grind.3. GRIND YOUR BEANS. Set your grinder to a mid coarse setting, as coarse as coarsely ground pepper, and experiment to get the dosage just right for your taste...I like the finer side of coarse. When your water almost boils, at about 210211 degrees F, turn off the heat and start your grinder and let the water temp drop a bit in the meantime.4. WEIGH WATER AS YOU POUR, THEN STEEP. While the grinder is grinding, pour hot water into your Press to warm it. When the grinding is completed, pour the warming water from the Press into your cup(s) to prewarm them, discard remaining water from the Press. Then pour your coffee grounds to the Press and place your Press on your scales, tare the Press to zero. To monitor heat place a thermometer in your Press. Now pour in the kettle's remaining 205208 degree F water into the Press as shown on your scale (I use 870900g in my 1 liter Press). Place the lid on the Press with plunger extended upward to begin the brewing cycle. Set your timer to 4 minutes.5. STIR, SINK, OR SCOOP OFF THE BLOOM. After after one minute, either gently stir, or sink the bloom with a spoon, or remove (break) the cake \"crust\" with a soup spoon (or two) to gently scoop to remove (clean) the bloom off the top to reduce the amount of fines in the brew. Be sure no grounds remain above the plunger or in the spout as those grounds will end up in your cup.6. REPLACE THE LID AND FINISH BREWING. With the lid on, continue to brew until the timer beeps, then press the plunger down VERY SLOWLY to the bottom (to reduce agitation of any fines present). Pour out the warming water from your cup(s), THEN pour in the hot coffee your cup(s).I hope this proves helpful to you.

      "\"One chews coffee beans while gargling 200 F water for four minutes; pressing with the tongue, coffee is then filtered through the teeth: is this the French press you refer to?\"  M. PythonAN INTRODUCTION TO COFFEE AMBROSIA. It's a quest for flavor, folks. It's all about flavor. You are here searching for the best quality French Press, one that delivers the most flavorful coffee possible. You might be new to French Press and are rightly skeptical about the vulnerability and safety of a glass model. Or, you might be experienced, a Bodum or BonJour refugee exasperated by having to replace your second, or third, or even your seventh broken glass beaker. No cuts? Lucky you. Been there. Below: First is a look at buying a French Press, followed by a Review of the Frieling French Press, then info on grinders, accessories, buying coffee, and brewing the best French Press. SHOPPING FOR A FRENCH PRESS: WHAT TO LOOK FORFIRST, WHAT IS FRENCH PRESS? Call it French Press, Press Pot, Cafetiere, Plunger Pot, Pressed Coffee, Coffee Press, or Cafe a Piston, it is all the same. Invented by an Italian man, popularized in France, \"French Press\" has emigrated to North America. The apparatus itself is strikingly simple: A handled pot, a lid, and a plunger. A French Press can be made of glass, metal, plastic, or ceramic. The pot is never placed on a stove burner...hot water is poured over ground coffee and steeped a few minutes, the plunger is pressed down, the brewed coffee is then poured into cups. French Press is a handson brewing method that allows the user to control brewing variables, adjusting for personal taste. This is a fullimmersion brewing method where the bed of grounds can steep, or soak, for a few minutes prior to pressing to terminate the brewing, thereby remarkably intensifying the brew's flavors and aromas when properly brewed using proper equipment. Usually, coarsely ground coffee beans are poured into the Press followed by offtheboil water, allowed to steep about four minutes at the correct temperature, then the pistonlike, porous filter plunger is slowly pressed down to filter and separate the grounds from the brewed coffee just prior to serving. A simple ritual indeed. In order to brew French Press you need a French Press. So, for shrewd shopping, French Press design features are discussed below...SIMPLICITY. No unnecessary parts means less parts to fail or to clean. ROBUST CONSTRUCTION: Your pot,lid and plunger should be of sturdy, durable construction using rustfree metals such as foodgrade stainless steel, high impact, BPAfree plastics, borosilicate glass, or quality ceramics with foodsafe glazes. The most durable, heavyduty quality is heavyduty restaurant/hotel commercial grade rather than the far less durable, lightduty consumer grade. INSULATION: Coffee Science has confirmed that coffee should be brewed at between 195 and 205 degrees F during the ENTIRE brewing cycle to release as much flavor and aroma as possible. The brewing cycle is usually four minutes for French Press. To keep temperatures within this range during the brewing cycle requires an INSULATED French Press. French Press designs that will do so are: thermal doublewall stainless or glass, thickwall ceramic designs, or inexpensive \"thermos\" designs. A heads up: An INSULATED French Press is a dedicated coffee BREWER, and is NOT a coffee storage vessel designed to store coffee after brewing...therefore it should NOT be confused with an INSULATED \"thermos,\" a design dedicated only to STORING hot or cold beverages. So, after brewing, immediately pour ALL coffee into cups or into an insulated thermos. This will immediately terminate brewing to avoid overextraction, producing a bitter cup. DISHWASHER SAFE. Ensure that your Press is dishwasher safe, and is easy to clean if handwashed. Look for hidden corners or crevices. Insist on dishwasher safe highheat resistant materials. EFFECTIVE FILTER. Your plunger's filter screen, the metal mesh, must filter, or separate, coffee grounds from the brewed coffee. The finer the screen the better it does so, BUT, and I mean the BIG BUT...no matter how good your grinder is, or your filter, some very fine particles will always make it through the filter, ending up at the bottom of your cup. It cannot be helped. Why?Because if the screen is too fine, almost solid, all grounds might be filtered out, but then it might be impossible to push the plunger to the bottom because of the resistance encountered when coffee cannot pass through the filter, yet if the filter screen is too porous then the amount of \"fines\" coming through the filter screen will markedly increase. The solution?Aside from optimal filter porosity, a quality burr grinder is key in reducing to a minimum the amount of \"fines\" coming into your cup. Even still, do not take the last sip...a bit of silt in the cup is a French Press thing...part of its reality, part of its pleasure...the price you pay for excellence in the cup. COMFORTABLE, SECURE HANDLE. You need a comfortable, secure, insulated handle. Look for a handle with a horizontal grip for the thumb and clearance for the fingers. Your handle should stay cool, especially when pouring. Its grip design should be comfy and encourage a confident, accurate pour. STABLE POT. Your Press should be stable enough to resist accidental tipping when struck: A Press can have tall proportions IF the weight is substantial. A base smaller that the width at any point is not a good design. DRIPLESS SPOUT. Your French Press should never drip or dribble when pouring...return it if it does so. Good design prevents that. SAFE TO USE. Your Press must be safe to use when not fully awake in the morning. As you know, accidents and fumbles can happen, so avoid materials that might shatter, crack, or injure you, as well as needing replacement. Only foodgrade 18/5 or the better 18/10 stainless steel should be used. Glass beakers should be highheat resistant, Pyrex type borosilicate glass. If plastics are used, ensure that they are foodsafe, BPAfree, and are not porous enough to harbor bacteria (or harbor stale coffee tastes and aromas). If ceramics are used, ensure that the glazes are food safe, cadmium and cobaltfree, or FDA approved. MATCHING YOUR FRENCH PRESS SIZE TO YOUR DESIRED COFFEE SERVING SIZEBUY THE RIGHT SIZE FOR YOUR DESIRED SERVING SIZE : When brewing fill the press no higher than an inch or more from the brim, or to the V at the bottom of the spout. This reduces capacity, but prevents coffee ejecting from the spout when pressing down. Room MUST be allowed for the halfinch to oneinch thick CO2 caused foamy \"bloom\" to rise, the water displacement of the plunger and spillage room. Do not forget the volume of the grounds either, and the 24 ounces of water retained by the grounds after pouring. Because of the facts mentioned above, any \"tothebrim\" capacity claimed by the maker must be adjusted downward by at least 26 fl. oz., in proportion to the size of the press. This goes for ALL brands and models of French Press products. For example, Frieling's stated capacities are often confusing and not clearly defined, so you might need to contact Freiling to ask questions prior to purchase, or read the below. Do so when shopping Bodum, BonJour, Frieling, or any brand of French Press. To eliminate confusion, you need to know the actual, always lesser, YIELD of served coffee in fluid ounces, not the maximum capacity, to the brim, of the French Presses you are comparing. If in doubt, go larger. A REVIEW OF THE FRIELING FRENCH PRESSPROS:1) FRIELING OWNERS ON AMAZON VOTE IT AN AVERAGE OF 4.7 STARS, 94% POSITIVE. You might have noticed that few products on Amazon are rated that highly.2) FRIELING MAKES FIVE SIZES FOR YOUR DESIRED PORTION SIZE. Frieling's stated sizes are at full capacity, but it is prudent to reduce that maximum capacity by about 26 fluid ounces, depending upon the size chosen, to allow space for the plunger and the inevitable rising head of bloomfoam when hot water hits the ground coffee. Accordingly, Frieling makes FIVE sizes to suit your capacity needs: 8 fl/oz, 16 fl/oz, 23 fl/oz, 36 fl/oz, and 44 fl/oz.3) DOUBLEWALL THERMAL INSULATION. Frieling makes only one model, the Ultimo, in polished or brushed finish. ALL its three main elements are hollow, doublewall insulated: the pot, the handle, AND the lid. So far, it is the only brand or model of French Press, with one exception, to possesses ALL three featuresthe insulated LID in particular. Such insulation will keep your brewing coffee at 195205 degrees F during the entire brewing cycle resulting in maximum flavor and aroma, as verified by the Specialty Coffee Association of America. FrielingUSA states that such insulation retains heat four times longer than a glass French press.4) 18/10 STAINLESS, COMMERCIALGRADE DURABILITY. Unique to Frieling, this heavy duty French Press is made of food grade, foodsafe solid stainless steel, 18/10 (18% chromium, 10% nickel: best quality), heavy gauge stainless steel stock. This quality, special alloy is foodsafe and leadfree, meant for commercial use in hotel roomservice and hotel dining rooms, for finecuisine restaurants, for caterers, and is sold to specialty, highend hotel/restaurant supply houses (still Frieling's primary business). Such high quality steel NEVER rusts or stains, and I mean NEVER. Also, it will never shatter or injure you. Survives dishwasher hell, and comes out looking like new. The Frieling was once under the radar. It is now available to the public at better coffeeware or kitchenware stores, and is available here on Amazon, far from its industrial roots. The interior is brushed, and because the stainless walls are solid all the way through, the plunger cannot scratch off any \"coating\" because there is no coating...so nothing can rust...as so many other reviewers here have confirmed. Neither the high speed metal brushed finish nor the mirror finish will affect its nonrust qualities...it is just a cosmetic thing.5) ITS FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION. Discipline and restraint, with utility in mind, results in the Frieling's handsome, elegant, and understated lines. Appearance has been given a slight nod. It's all business. Even its high polish is not there to WOW at, but to make it easier to clean. There are no false touches present; only the authentic remains. The entire achievement makes it presentable for casual entertaining, even for more formal occasions. A matching sugar and creamer, with spoon, is available. Its tall, slightly narrow profile has a small footprint, taking up little space on the counter or the table. Shopper's note: Confusing an insulated Press with an insulated carafe is a very common blunder. ANY brand of thermal insulated French Press is specifically designed as a brewer, NOT as a thermal carafe or thermos, so brewed coffee MUST be poured into cups IMMEDIATELY after the four minute brewing period or the continued steeping will produce, even if over a minute, an overextracted, bitter, and insipid cup! For leftover coffee, use a preheated thermal carafe or thermos, with a screwon sealed lid, specifically designed to store hot coffee, and to keep it hot, after it is brewed. Actually, it is best not to store coffee. Consume coffee within 1015 minutes for the best flavor. For more coffee simply brew more coffee for the best flavor.6) THE POT'S SMALL SPOUT is dripless due to its lipped design. Not a stray drop on the tablecloth yet after four years of daily use. The spout is small enough to lose minimal heat, and I tested the heat loss by plugging the spout with window pane putty and measured only a one degree F heat loss compared to an open spout when brewing. It therefore needs no mechanism to close the spout. You will discover that the spout is large enough for a quick, steepstopping pour.7) THE INSULATED LID is entirely unique. It is, with one exception, the only INSULATED lid for a French Press to be found by any manufacturer. Heat rises, and as far as heat is concerned, the pot functions as a chimney, focusing heat above, and its opening is where most heat is lost. This lid caps the heat with its tight fit and insulation. The lid's underside dome shape helps assist in that, like a domed teakettle. The overall lid design is critical if you care to brew at the proper 195205 degree F temperature. THIS WAS THE FINAL KICKER IN MY DECISION TO CHOOSE THE FRIELING, along with the other goodies.8) THE INSULATED HANDLE is crafted of hollow, extruded stainless, all of a piece, to keep it cool, as well as to keep it llight weight so as not to unsteady the pot. The handle's vertical upright is ovoid in crosssection to provide comfort for the gripping fingers. A secure niche for the thumb is provided with its horizontal thumb rest and thumbblock. An often overlooked feature in cup or French Press design, because if the thumb rests on on a horizontal support, especially if that support is provided with a means of blocking the thumb from slipping off, one's grip is then very secure indeed. Take a look at the photo of the handle on this site, you'll see it. The long, vertical provides plenty of clearance for the fingers, and is angled inward toward the bottom to secure the fingers, also to provide good leverage when pouring.9) THE PLUNGER, when pushed down, results in a dynamic turbulence that agitates the water and grounds to intensify flavors...this is the heart of the Press, and what makes French Press what it is. It also separates the grounds from the coffee, so it is fitted to precise specifications to minimize stray grounds coming through the filter or from between the pot's inner walls and the periphery of the plunger, and thence into the cup. The unit is entirely crafted from 18/10 stainless steel (the best grade)...no plastic parts to retain stale tastes whatsoever. Easy to dissemble for cleaning and spare parts are always available. Remember, with ANY French Press you will have stray grounds, especially if you buy canned coffee because it is always ground too fine for French Press, or if you use anything but a burr grinder. Even so, tiny grounds sneak in...French Pressists never sip that last sip: don't blame the Frieling Press, or a Bodum, or a BonJour.10) REPLACEMENT PARTS AND EXCHANGES FOR VALID PROBLEMS ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE. My online and telephone experience with Frieling USA has been excellent. They will replace any product or part you feel is defective. Also, down the line, parts such as the filter screen. cross plate, spiral plate of the plunger assembly, or the plunger rod, are available at very reasonable prices.11) FRIELING KEEPS GOOD COMPANY. Beside Amazon, the finest, most prestigious online coffee gear retailers carry it: cateringplanet, wholelattelove, seattlecoffeegear, clivecoffee, terroircoffee, williamssonoma, espressozone, shop. illy, chriscoffee, liquidplanet, roaste, crateandbarrel, coffee. become, coffeebydesign, coffeeart, veniacoffee, greentreecoffee, blacksmithcoffee, wayfair, etc.12) USEFUL FOR MAKING \"OPEN POT\" COFFEE. You can also use this for \"OPEN POT\" brewing, the simple, \"connoisseur's method,\" also called \"Cowboy Coffee.\" With this method, you simply dose a pot with coffee, pour in offboil water, and steep with the lid on, but with the plunger extended just, stir three times during the steep, after the four minute steep pour through a fine filter into your cup. The flavor is similar to French Pressed coffee.13) USEFUL AS AN INSULATED SERVING PITCHER FOR HOT OR COLD DRINKS. Use the Freiling for serving cold juices, milk, or ice water; use it for serving hot syrup, hot chocolate, hot milk, etc.14) EASY TO CLEAN. The Freiling is dishwasher safe and that will remove any water spots or fingerprints with ease. The plunger filter assembly does not need to be taken apart to clean. Handwashing is often used when camping. Coffee oils build up on grinders and coffee makers of any kind...same here. So, periodically, when you see a thin brown film, use a watervinegar solution and let soak overnight, then scrub well. CONS:1) THE LID CAN SLIP FORWARD A BIT WHEN POURING: The lid is snug for pressing, but while pouring, the lid can slip forward a half inch or so. Solutionthe \"teapot pour\", the way waitstaff use it: with the finger(s) of one hand, lightly press down on the lid, the other hand grips the handle to pour. Or, use the \"onehand pour\": grip the handle with your fingers, press down lightly with side of your thumb upon the flat of the lid's back edge, or use the index finger as another reviewer here mentioned, then pour...easy and secure. If you are extremely heatsensitive just use a potholder to hold to lid. I never need to, and neither do my Frieling French Press using friends, including my daughter.2) A FEW SMALL PARTICLES OF GRIND CAN CATCH IN THE PLUNGER, in the tiny screen seam. SolutionIf that happens, then after brewing and rinsing out your Frieling, fill with hot water, replace lid and plunger. Then, pumping vigorously up and down a few times, the turbulence removes the particles. I seldom have to do that twice or use a small brush. Then place the pot and plunger in the dishwasher.3) FRIELING'S SIZING IS CONFUSING CUSTOMERS: Capacities of Frieling's presses are often expressed in two capacities: he \"serving\" capacity and the \"maximum capacity\" when used as a serving carafe for liquids other than coffee. Very often the \"serving capacity\" is not accurate, serving less than the amount stated. Moreover, various vendors, Amazon sellers, and other retailers list the same model at different capacities. It is maddening. Not only that, but most customers do not know that the \"cups\" Frieling and all coffee manufacturers refer to are actually the European \"Tasse\" cup of 4.22 fluid oz each (1/8 liter, 125ml), NOT the US 8oz measuring cup, so customers often feel misinformed when coffee servings are HALF what they expected. Frieling is innocent of misrepresentation here: it is customer ignorance that is at fault. Regardless, Frieling needs to address this issue ASAP and give us the ACTUAL YIELD per serving, in US fluid ounces, of each size offered. CONCLUSIONThe Frieling French presses are a commercial, industrial design with commercialgrade stainless, insulated everywhere, including the lid, easier to clean than with plastic parts that also retain flavors. Holds the brew temperature at the correct SCAA recommended 195205 degrees, the most important brewing feature of all. Dishwasher hardy and cleanup is easy. Handsome and presentable for entertaining. Durable to the maximum. Excellent, all stainless plunger, few stray particles, produces minimal silt. Highly recommended. 4.8 Amazon stars.

LA CAFETIERE THERMIQUE 8c, $35, 4.2 stars: NO plastics, INSULATED LID, drips, MIXED REVIEWS, stable. P.S. Most of the above brands and models, Bodum and BonJour in particular, I respect for their overall quality, if not for the plastic parts. They, and Frieling, all make similar coffee, but with varying degrees of insulation efficiency and thus very noticeable flavorintensity outcomes. Being consumergrade products, they are not expected to be as durable as commercialgrade equivalents, such as Frieling, due to their intended work environment. Consequently, their comparison with the Frieling is a bit unfair...like comparing apples to oranges. Always buy commercial products whenever possible...the tough guys. By the way, if you remain loyal to glassbeakered Presses, the doubleglass wall, insulated version of the iconic Bodum Chambord 8c ($80) is available (being that glass holds in heat better than metal, I can recommend it), but a replacement beaker is $50, $130 total Amazon. If insulation is not important to you, the glass beakered, single walled, Bodum Eileen ($67 Amazon for the 8c), with its \"full metal perforated jacket\" of stainless, is widely used in French restaurants and bistros as a commercial Press; it is fairly durable for a single wall Press due to the metal sheath, but its single wall will NOT keep the brew at the right temperature. A REBUTTAL OF THE MOST COMMON CRITICAL REVIEWS, AND SOME OVER THE TOP ONESTHE COMMON ONES1) \"Some grounds and silt bypass the filter and are in my cup.\" Answer: some will always pass through, it is a French Press thing, common to all brands and models...French Pressists never take that last sip. But there are three ways to dramatically reduce that, 1) the fault, almost invariably, USING A WHIRLYBLADE GRINDER, or the LACK OF A CONICAL BURR GRINDER that allows you to grind EVENLY and COARSELY, no more dustandboulders; or b) not grinding COARSELY enough with any grinder; or c) buying CANNED OR PACKAGED PREGROUND coffee ground FINE for drip coffee so that fine grounds can bypass the French Press's filter. Grind mediumcourse for French Press, not\" fine. If you have no good grinder then have your coffee source grind it coarsely for you.2) \"My coffee does not stay hot very long after I pour it.\" Answer: ANY brand of French Press is designed to BREW coffee, and NOT TO STORE IT. Period. Stainless Steel, or glass, doublewalled Presses are designed to keep the brewing coffee at the correct temperature (195205 degrees) DURING THE BREW CYCLE and are NOT MEANT TO STORE COFFEE AFTER THE BREW CYCLE IS COMPLETED. If the steep goes much past 4 minutes you get nasty coffeeoverextracted and bitter. I am convinced that the confusion comes from mistaking what it looks like: an insulated pot \"looks\" like a thermos, or insulated carafe. Well, it's not. It's a brewer. Timing is critical when making any coffee. Espresso Baristas use a timer to cut short their pull at 2530 seconds per shot, with French Press (and drip) set your timer to 3.5 to 4.5 minutes per extraction (4 minutes is the sweet spot).3)\"I get this metallic taste (or bitter taste, or stale taste, take your pick).\" Stainless steel, especially foodgrade 18/10 stainless used in the Frieling, is famed for imparting ZERO taste to food or beverages. It's what it's known for. The offtastes come from other sources such as, a) coffeol oil and collagen residues adhering to the Press wall, or in your grinder, or both...keep them clean, or 2) certain coffees give off unusual flavor notes also, or c) your water might be less than ideal, or d) your dishwash detergent is not thoroughly rinsed off. It's NOT the metal itself. THE OVERTHETOP ONES\"The handle breaks off,\" or \"has a sloppy weld.\" Or, \"Cannot clean the thing at all.\" Or, \"I get gray powder on my paper towel when I wipe it out.\" Answer: These are over the top, spoiler, dealkilling statements and are intended to be so, for various malicious reasons, I remain convinced, and so utterly lacking in truth that they are laughable. The laserweld on the handle is so secure that the restaurant supply managers I personally know say they have never experienced any handle failures or sloppy welds, none, ever. Dirty Stainless is not 18/10 stainless's fault, so if really neglected use foodservice's favorite: Barkeeper's Friend, use it gently, rinse. Lastly...\"It shows fingerprints all the time, and spots\"...uh, well, wipe them off, how hard is that? Or sell it on ebay and buy the new matte brushedfinish Frieling. Gray powder on the inside? Not possible with 18/10 Stainless...has to be bad water or bad dishwashing detergent, come on, think of a better pot shot. Frieling's positive 4 & 5 star reviews are 94% of the total here. That is highly unusual on Amazon. So don't worry, the $75 is only about $10 more than the lesser Bodums you might be shopping. It is money well spent, lasting for many, many years. I cherish my Frieling, and so will you. THE COFFEE HOUSE FRENCH PRESS BREW METHOD: The Hows and Whys USE CLEAN, COLD WATER. Brewing with a French Press is simple and easy. You have to know how to do it and WHY you are doing it to extract the most flavor possible. Essentially, your water flavor must be good so you begin by using cold, filtered water. You fill your kettle with TWICE the water needed: half to prewarm your Press and the other half for brewing. USE THE RIGHT DOSE OF COFFEE BEANS. Dose coffee beans at 5565g of coffee beans per liter of water, or 70 grams if you \"break and clean\" (rather than stirring the bloom, you break the bloom foam cake and spoon out the surface grounds to reduce the fines, in which case you sacrifice some brewing grounds, so you need to overdose a bit).  Use a kitchen scale to measure. BEGIN GRINDING THE BEANS JUST BEFORE THE WATER BOILS. Once the bean husk is cracked open favor immediately escapes, so wait until the last minute to grind, just as the water begins to boil. BREW AT THE CORRECT TEMPERATURE.  As the water almost boils, start your grinder, prewarm your Press with half the offboil water, empty the Press and fill with the grounds weighed on a scale. Then pour in the other half of the water, using a scale to measure, at about 205208 degrees F so as the temperature drops during the brew you are NEVER brewing lower than 195 degrees F. NEVER begin at 195 degrees F or flavor really suffers as the temp at brew's end can even drop to 185 degrees F...not good! BREW FOR THE CORRECT TIME. A fourminute brew cycle is highly recommended. Anything less gives you a raw, underextracted cup, anything more gives you an overcooked, overextracted, bitter cup. At Brew's end, ALWAYS pour out coffee into cups to terminate the brewing. NEVER store coffee in any coffee brewer as it will continue to brew! Even with drip brewing coffee is stored in a carafe...do that same here. A coffee brewer of any kind is NOT a coffee storage carafe. That is a job for a thermally insulated carafe. The insulation in a French Press is there to keep the brew at the correct temperature DURING the brew cycle. BREWING IT: An upclose look at brewing French Press Coffee1. FILL KETTLE with at least TWICE the water needed to brew. Use only fresh, neverboiled, COLD, FILTERED water, not the nasty tasting, mildly rusty hot water sitting inside your hot water heater. Now begin heating your water at high heat.2. WEIGH YOUR BEANS. While the water heats, place your grinder's groundscollecting bin on your scales, then tare to zero. After weighing, pour the beans into the grinder's hopper, then place the grounds bin in the grinder to catch the grounds when you grind.3. GRIND YOUR BEANS. Set your grinder to a mid coarse setting, as coarse as coarsely ground pepper, and experiment to get the dosage just right for your taste...I like the finer side of coarse.  When your water almost boils, at about 210211 degrees F, turn off the heat and start your grinder and let the water temp drop a bit in the meantime.4. WEIGH WATER AS YOU POUR, THEN STEEP. While the grinder is grinding, pour hot water into your Press to warm it.  When the grinding is completed, pour the warming water from the Press into your cup(s) to prewarm them, discard remaining water from the Press. Then pour your coffee grounds to the Press and place your Press on your scales, tare the Press to zero. To monitor heat place a thermometer in your Press. Now pour in the kettle's remaining 205208 degree F water into the Press as shown on your scale (I use 870900g in my 1 liter Press). Place the lid on the Press with plunger extended upward to begin the brewing cycle. Set your timer to 4 minutes.5. STIR, SINK, OR SCOOP OFF THE BLOOM. After after one minute, either gently stir, or sink the bloom with a spoon, or remove (break) the cake \"crust\" with a soup spoon (or two) to gently scoop to remove (clean) the bloom off the top to reduce the amount of fines in the brew. Be sure no grounds remain above the plunger or in the spout as those grounds will end up in your cup.6. REPLACE THE LID AND FINISH BREWING. With the lid on, continue to brew until the timer beeps, then press the plunger down VERY SLOWLY to the bottom (to reduce agitation of any fines present). Pour out the warming water from your cup(s), THEN pour in the hot coffee from the Press to replace it. Serve and enjoy. This is the ambrosia people are talking about...properly made French Press. Note: Hoping to cover all the bases, and to eliminate any confusion, I have gone into great detail so you know not only HOW to properly make French Press, but also WHY you make it that way. Making French Press is actually a very simple ritual once you do it a few times, much simpler than it appears in the above. NOTE: The French Press pictured above is the highly regarded doublewalled insulated Frieling Ultimo French Press made of 100% 18/10 stainless steel with a stainless steel lid and parts..no plastic parts in the lid or filter plunger. The Frieling is a fine hotel and restaurant grade product available in five sizes. Available in mirror polished or brushed matte finishes.

      "\"One chews coffee beans while gargling 200 F water for four minutes; pressing with the tongue, coffee is filtered through the teeth: is this the French press you refer to?\"  M. PythonAN INTRODUCTION TO COFFEE AMBROSIA. It's a quest for flavor. It's all about flavor. You are here searching for the best quality French Press, one that delivers the most flavorful coffee possible. You might be new to French Press and are rightly skeptical about the vulnerability and safety of a glass model. Or, you might be experienced, a Bodum or BonJour refugee exasperated by having to replace your second, or third, or even your seventh broken glass beaker. No cuts? Lucky you. Been there. Below: First is a look at buying a French Press, followed by a Review of the Frieling French Press, then info on grinders, accessories, buying coffee, and brewing the best French Press. SHOPPING FOR A FRENCH PRESS: WHAT TO LOOK FORFIRST, WHAT IS FRENCH PRESS? Call it French Press, Press Pot, Cafetiere, Plunger Pot, Pressed Coffee, Coffee Press, or Cafe a Piston, it is all the same. Invented by an Italian man, popularized in France, \"French Press\" has emigrated to North America. The apparatus itself is strikingly simple: A handled pot, a lid, and a plunger. A French Press can be made of glass, metal, plastic, or ceramic. The pot is never placed on a stove burner...hot water is poured over ground coffee and steeped a few minutes, the plunger is pressed down, the brewed coffee is then poured into cups. French Press is a handson brewing method that allows the user to control brewing variables, adjusting for personal taste. This is a fullimmersion brewing method where the bed of grounds can steep, or soak, for a few minutes prior to pressing to terminate the brewing, thereby remarkably intensifying the brew's flavors and aromas when properly brewed using proper equipment. Usually, coarsely ground coffee beans are poured into the Press followed by offtheboil water, allowed to steep about four minutes at the correct temperature, then the pistonlike, porous filter plunger is slowly pressed down to filter and separate the grounds from the brewed coffee just prior to serving. A simple ritual indeed. In order to brew French Press you need a French Press. So, for shrewd shopping, French Press design features are discussed below...SIMPLICITY. No unnecessary parts means less parts to fail or to clean. ROBUST CONSTRUCTION: Your pot,lid and plunger should be of sturdy, durable construction using rustfree metals such as foodgrade stainless steel, high impact, BPAfree plastics, borosilicate glass, or quality ceramics with foodsafe glazes. The most durable, heavyduty quality is heavyduty restaurant/hotel commercial grade rather than the far less durable, lightduty consumer grade. INSULATION: Coffee Science has confirmed that coffee should be brewed at between 195 and 205 degrees F during the ENTIRE brewing cycle to release as much flavor and aroma as possible. The brewing cycle is usually four minutes for French Press. To keep temperatures within this range during the brewing cycle requires an INSULATED French Press. French Press designs that will do so are: thermal doublewall stainless or glass, thickwall ceramic designs, or inexpensive \"thermos\" designs. A heads up: An INSULATED French Press is a dedicated coffee BREWER, and is NOT a coffee storage vessel designed to store coffee after brewing...therefore it should NOT be confused with an INSULATED \"thermos,\" a design dedicated only to STORING hot or cold beverages. So, after brewing, immediately pour ALL coffee into cups or into an insulated thermos. This will immediately terminate brewing to avoid overextraction, producing a bitter cup. DISHWASHER SAFE. Ensure that your Press is dishwasher safe, and is easy to clean if handwashed. Look for hidden corners or crevices. Insist on dishwasher safe highheat resistant materials. EFFECTIVE FILTER. Your plunger's filter screen, the metal mesh, must filter, or separate, coffee grounds from the brewed coffee. The finer the screen the better it does so, BUT, and I mean the BIG BUT...no matter how good your grinder is, or your filter, some very fine particles will always make it through the filter, ending up at the bottom of your cup. It cannot be helped. Why?Because if the screen is too fine, almost solid, all grounds might be filtered out, but then it might be impossible to push the plunger to the bottom because of the resistance encountered when coffee cannot pass through the filter, yet if the filter screen is too porous then the amount of \"fines\" coming through the filter screen will markedly increase. The solution?Aside from optimal filter porosity, a quality burr grinder is key in reducing to a minimum the amount of \"fines\" coming into your cup. Even still, do not take the last sip...a bit of silt in the cup is a French Press thing...part of its reality, part of its pleasure...the price you pay for excellence in the cup. COMFORTABLE, SECURE HANDLE. You need a comfortable, secure, insulated handle. Look for a handle with a horizontal grip for the thumb and clearance for the fingers. Your handle should stay cool, especially when pouring. Its grip design should be comfy and encourage a confident, accurate pour. STABLE POT. Your Press should be stable enough to resist accidental tipping when struck: A Press can have tall proportions IF the weight is substantial. A base smaller that the width at any point is not a good design. DRIPLESS SPOUT. Your French Press should never drip or dribble when pouring...return it if it does so. Good design prevents that. SAFE TO USE. Your Press must be safe to use when not fully awake in the morning. As you know, accidents and fumbles can happen, so avoid materials that might shatter, crack, or injure you, as well as needing replacement. Only foodgrade 18/5 or the better 18/10 stainless steel should be used. Glass beakers should be highheat resistant, Pyrex type borosilicate glass. If plastics are used, ensure that they are foodsafe, BPAfree, and are not porous enough to harbor bacteria (or harbor stale coffee tastes and aromas). If ceramics are used, ensure that the glazes are food safe, cadmium and cobaltfree, or FDA approved. MATCHING YOUR FRENCH PRESS SIZE TO YOUR DESIRED COFFEE SERVING SIZEBUY THE RIGHT SIZE FOR YOUR DESIRED SERVING SIZE : When brewing fill the press no higher than an inch or more from the brim, or to the V at the bottom of the spout. This reduces capacity, but prevents coffee ejecting from the spout when pressing down. Room MUST be allowed for the halfinch to oneinch thick CO2 caused foamy \"bloom\" to rise, the water displacement of the plunger and spillage room. Do not forget the volume of the grounds either, and the 24 ounces of water retained by the grounds after pouring. Because of the facts mentioned above, any \"tothebrim\" capacity claimed by the maker must be adjusted downward by at least 26 fl. oz., in proportion to the size of the press. This goes for ALL brands and models of French Press products. For example, Frieling's stated capacities are often confusing and not clearly defined, so you might need to contact Freiling to ask questions prior to purchase, or read the below. Do so when shopping Bodum, BonJour, Frieling, or any brand of French Press. To eliminate confusion, you need to know the actual, always lesser, YIELD of served coffee in fluid ounces, not the maximum capacity, to the brim, of the French Presses you are comparing. If in doubt, go larger. A REVIEW OF THE FRIELING FRENCH PRESSPROS:1) FRIELING OWNERS HERE ON AMAZON VOTE IT 4.7 STARS, 94% POSITIVE. You might have noticed that only a few products on Amazon are rated that highly.2) FRIELING MAKES FIVE SIZES FOR YOUR DESIRED PORTION SIZE. Frieling's stated sizes are at full capacity, but it is prudent to reduce that maximum capacity by about 26 fluid ounces, depending upon the size chosen, to allow space for the plunger and the inevitable rising head of bloomfoam when hot water hits the ground coffee. Accordingly, Frieling makes FIVE sizes to suit your capacity needs: 8 fl/oz, 16 fl/oz, 23 fl/oz, 36 fl/oz, and 44 fl/oz.3) DOUBLEWALL THERMAL INSULATION. Frieling makes only one model, the Ultimo, in polished or brushed finish. ALL its three main elements are hollow, doublewall insulated: the pot, the handle, AND the lid. So far, it is the only brand or model of French Press, with one exception, to possesses ALL three featuresthe insulated LID in particular. Such insulation will keep your brewing coffee at 195205 degrees F during the entire brewing cycle resulting in maximum flavor and aroma, as verified by the Specialty Coffee Association of America. FrielingUSA states that such insulation retains heat four times longer than a glass French press.4) 18/10 STAINLESS, COMMERCIALGRADE DURABILITY. Unique to Frieling, this heavy duty French Press is made of food grade, foodsafe solid stainless steel, 18/10 (18% chromium, 10% nickel: best quality), heavy gauge stainless steel stock. This quality, special alloy is foodsafe and leadfree, meant for commercial use in hotel roomservice and hotel dining rooms, for finecuisine restaurants, for caterers, and is sold to specialty, highend hotel/restaurant supply houses (still Frieling's primary business). Such high quality steel NEVER rusts or stains, and I mean NEVER. Also, it will never shatter or injure you. Survives dishwasher hell, and comes out looking like new. The Frieling was once under the radar. It is now available to the public at better coffeeware or kitchenware stores, and is available here on Amazon, far from its industrial roots. The interior is brushed, and because the stainless walls are solid all the way through, the plunger cannot scratch off any \"coating\" because there is no coating...so nothing can rust...as so many other reviewers here have confirmed. Neither the high speed metal brushed finish nor the mirror finish will affect its nonrust qualities...it is just a cosmetic thing.5) ITS FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION. Discipline and restraint, with utility in mind, results in the Frieling's handsome, elegant, and understated lines. Appearance has been given a slight nod. It's all business. Even its high polish is not there to WOW at, but to make it easier to clean. There are no false touches present; only the authentic remains. The entire achievement makes it presentable for casual entertaining, even for more formal occasions. A matching sugar and creamer, with spoon, is available. Its tall, slightly narrow profile has a small footprint, taking up little space on the counter or the table. Shopper's note: Confusing an insulated Press with an insulated carafe is a very common blunder. ANY brand of thermal insulated French Press is specifically designed as a brewer, NOT as a thermal carafe or thermos, so brewed coffee MUST be poured into cups IMMEDIATELY after the four minute brewing period or the continued steeping will produce, even if over a minute, an overextracted, bitter, and insipid cup! For leftover coffee, use a preheated thermal carafe or thermos, with a screwon sealed lid, specifically designed to store hot coffee, and to keep it hot, after it is brewed. Actually, it is best not to store coffee. Consume coffee within 1015 minutes for the best flavor. For more coffee simply brew more coffee for the best flavor.6) THE POT'S SMALL SPOUT is dripless due to its lipped design. Not a stray drop on the tablecloth yet after four years of daily use. The spout is small enough to lose minimal heat, and I tested the heat loss by plugging the spout with window pane putty and measured only a one degree F heat loss compared to an open spout when brewing. It therefore needs no mechanism to close the spout. You will discover that the spout is large enough for a quick, steepstopping pour.7) THE INSULATED LID is entirely unique. It is, with one exception, the only INSULATED lid for a French Press to be found by any manufacturer. Heat rises, and as far as heat is concerned, the pot functions as a chimney, focusing heat above, and its opening is where most heat is lost. This lid caps the heat with its tight fit and insulation. The lid's underside dome shape helps assist in that, like a domed teakettle. The overall lid design is critical if you care to brew at the proper 195205 degree F temperature. THIS WAS THE FINAL KICKER IN MY DECISION TO CHOOSE THE FRIELING, along with the other goodies.8) THE INSULATED HANDLE is crafted of hollow, extruded stainless, all of a piece, to keep it cool, as well as to keep it llight weight so as not to unsteady the pot. The handle's vertical upright is ovoid in crosssection to provide comfort for the gripping fingers. A secure niche for the thumb is provided with its horizontal thumb rest and thumbblock. An often overlooked feature in cup or French Press design, because if the thumb rests on on a horizontal support, especially if that support is provided with a means of blocking the thumb from slipping off, one's grip is then very secure indeed. Take a look at the photo of the handle on this site, you'll see it. The long, vertical provides plenty of clearance for the fingers, and is angled inward toward the bottom to secure the fingers, also to provide good leverage when pouring.9) THE PLUNGER, when pushed down, results in a dynamic turbulence that agitates the water and grounds to intensify flavors...this is the heart of the Press, and what makes French Press what it is. It also separates the grounds from the coffee, so it is fitted to precise specifications to minimize stray grounds coming through the filter or from between the pot's inner walls and the periphery of the plunger, and thence into the cup. The unit is entirely crafted from 18/10 stainless steel (the best grade)...no plastic parts to retain stale tastes whatsoever. Easy to dissemble for cleaning and spare parts are always available. Remember, with ANY French Press you will have stray grounds, especially if you buy canned coffee because it is always ground too fine for French Press, or if you use anything but a burr grinder. Even so, tiny grounds sneak in...French Pressists never sip that last sip: don't blame the Frieling Press, or a Bodum, or a BonJour.10) REPLACEMENT PARTS AND EXCHANGES FOR VALID PROBLEMS ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE. My online and telephone experience with Frieling USA has been excellent. They will replace any product or part you feel is defective. Also, down the line, parts such as the filter screen. cross plate, spiral plate of the plunger assembly, or the plunger rod, are available at very reasonable prices.11) FRIELING KEEPS GOOD COMPANY. Beside Amazon, the finest, most prestigious online coffee gear retailers carry it: cateringplanet, wholelattelove, seattlecoffeegear, clivecoffee, terroircoffee, williamssonoma, espressozone, shop. illy, chriscoffee, liquidplanet, roaste, crateandbarrel, coffee. become, coffeebydesign, coffeeart, veniacoffee, greentreecoffee, blacksmithcoffee, wayfair, etc.12) USEFUL FOR MAKING \"OPEN POT\" COFFEE. You can also use this for \"OPEN POT\" brewing, the simple, \"connoisseur's method,\" also called \"Cowboy Coffee.\" With this method, you simply dose a pot with coffee, pour in offboil water, and steep with the lid on, but with the plunger extended just, stir three times during the steep, after the four minute steep pour through a fine filter into your cup. The flavor is similar to French Pressed coffee.13) USEFUL AS AN INSULATED SERVING PITCHER FOR HOT OR COLD DRINKS. Use the Freiling for serving cold juices, milk, or ice water; use it for serving hot syrup, hot chocolate, hot milk, etc.14) EASY TO CLEAN. The Freiling is dishwasher safe and that will remove any water spots or fingerprints with ease. The plunger filter assembly does not need to be taken apart to clean. Handwashing is often used when camping. Coffee oils build up on grinders and coffee makers of any kind...same here. So, periodically, when you see a thin brown film, use a watervinegar solution and let soak overnight, then scrub well. CONS:1) THE LID CAN SLIP FORWARD A BIT WHEN POURING: The lid is snug for pressing, but while pouring, the lid can slip forward a half inch or so. Solutionthe \"teapot pour\", the way waitstaff use it: with the finger(s) of one hand, lightly press down on the lid, the other hand grips the handle to pour. Or, use the \"onehand pour\": grip the handle with your fingers, press down lightly with side of your thumb upon the flat of the lid's back edge, or use the index finger as another reviewer here mentioned, then pour...easy and secure. If you are extremely heatsensitive just use a potholder to hold to lid. I never need to, and neither do my Frieling French Press using friends, including my daughter.2) A FEW SMALL PARTICLES OF GRIND CAN CATCH IN THE PLUNGER, in the tiny screen seam. SolutionIf that happens, then after brewing and rinsing out your Frieling, fill with hot water, replace lid and plunger. Then, pumping vigorously up and down a few times, the turbulence removes the particles. I seldom have to do that twice or use a small brush. Then place the pot and plunger in the dishwasher.3) FRIELING'S SIZING IS CONFUSING CUSTOMERS: Capacities of Frieling's presses are often expressed in two capacities: he \"serving\" capacity and the \"maximum capacity\" when used as a serving carafe for liquids other than coffee. Very often the \"serving capacity\" is not accurate, serving less than the amount stated. Moreover, various vendors, Amazon sellers, and other retailers list the same model at different capacities. It is maddening. Not only that, but most customers do not know that the \"cups\" Frieling and all coffee manufacturers refer to are actually the European \"Tasse\" cup of 4.22 fluid oz each (1/8 liter, 125ml), NOT the US 8oz measuring cup, so customers often feel misinformed when coffee servings are HALF what they expected. Frieling is innocent of misrepresentation here: it is customer ignorance that is at fault. Regardless, Frieling needs to address this issue ASAP and give us the ACTUAL YIELD per serving, in US fluid ounces, of each size offered. CONCLUSIONThe Frieling French presses are a commercial, industrial design with commercialgrade stainless, insulated everywhere, including the lid, easier to clean than with plastic parts that also retain flavors. Holds the brew temperature at the correct SCAA recommended 195205 degrees, the most important brewing feature of all. Dishwasher hardy and cleanup is easy. Handsome and presentable for entertaining. Durable to the maximum. Excellent, all stainless plunger, few stray particles, produces minimal silt. Highly recommended. 4.8 Amazon stars.

LA CAFETIERE THERMIQUE 8c, $35, 4.2 stars: NO plastics, INSULATED LID, drips, MIXED REVIEWS, stable. P.S. Most of the above brands and models, Bodum and BonJour in particular, I respect for their overall quality, if not for the plastic parts. They, and Frieling, all make similar coffee, but with varying degrees of insulation efficiency and thus very noticeable flavorintensity outcomes. Being consumergrade products, they are not expected to be as durable as commercialgrade equivalents, such as Frieling, due to their intended work environment. Consequently, their comparison with the Frieling is a bit unfair...like comparing apples to oranges. Always buy commercial products whenever possible...the tough guys. By the way, if you remain loyal to glassbeakered Presses, the doubleglass wall, insulated version of the iconic Bodum Chambord 8c ($80) is available (being that glass holds in heat better than metal, I can recommend it), but a replacement beaker is $50, $130 total Amazon. If insulation is not important to you, the glass beakered, single walled, Bodum Eileen ($67 Amazon for the 8c), with its \"full metal perforated jacket\" of stainless, is widely used in French restaurants and bistros as a commercial Press; it is fairly durable for a single wall Press due to the metal sheath, but its single wall will NOT keep the brew at the right temperature. A REBUTTAL OF THE MOST COMMON CRITICAL REVIEWS, AND SOME OVER THE TOP ONESTHE COMMON ONES1) \"Some grounds and silt bypass the filter and are in my cup.\" Answer: some will always pass through, it is a French Press thing, common to all brands and models...French Pressists never take that last sip. But there are three ways to dramatically reduce that, 1) the fault, almost invariably, USING A WHIRLYBLADE GRINDER, or the LACK OF A CONICAL BURR GRINDER that allows you to grind EVENLY and COARSELY, no more dustandboulders; or b) not grinding COARSELY enough with any grinder; or c) buying CANNED OR PACKAGED PREGROUND coffee ground FINE for drip coffee so that fine grounds can bypass the French Press's filter. Grind mediumcourse for French Press, not\" fine. If you have no good grinder then have your coffee source grind it coarsely for you.2) \"My coffee does not stay hot very long after I pour it.\" Answer: ANY brand of French Press is designed to BREW coffee, and NOT TO STORE IT. Period. Stainless Steel, or glass, doublewalled Presses are designed to keep the brewing coffee at the correct temperature (195205 degrees) DURING THE BREW CYCLE and are NOT MEANT TO STORE COFFEE AFTER THE BREW CYCLE IS COMPLETED. If the steep goes much past 4 minutes you get nasty coffeeoverextracted and bitter. I am convinced that the confusion comes from mistaking what it looks like: an insulated pot \"looks\" like a thermos, or insulated carafe. Well, it's not. It's a brewer. Timing is critical when making any coffee. Espresso Baristas use a timer to cut short their pull at 2530 seconds per shot, with French Press (and drip) set your timer to 3.5 to 4.5 minutes per extraction (4 minutes is the sweet spot).3)\"I get this metallic taste (or bitter taste, or stale taste, take your pick).\" Stainless steel, especially foodgrade 18/10 stainless used in the Frieling, is famed for imparting ZERO taste to food or beverages. It's what it's known for. The offtastes come from other sources such as, a) coffeol oil and collagen residues adhering to the Press wall, or in your grinder, or both...keep them clean, or 2) certain coffees give off unusual flavor notes also, or c) your water might be less than ideal, or d) your dishwash detergent is not thoroughly rinsed off. It's NOT the metal itself. THE OVERTHETOP ONES\"The handle breaks off,\" or \"has a sloppy weld.\" Or, \"Cannot clean the thing at all.\" Or, \"I get gray powder on my paper towel when I wipe it out.\" Answer: These are over the top, spoiler, dealkilling statements and are intended to be so, for various malicious reasons, I remain convinced, and so utterly lacking in truth that they are laughable. The laserweld on the handle is so secure that the restaurant supply managers I personally know say they have never experienced any handle failures or sloppy welds, none, ever. Dirty Stainless is not 18/10 stainless's fault, so if really neglected use foodservice's favorite: Barkeeper's Friend, use it gently, rinse. Lastly...\"It shows fingerprints all the time, and spots\"...uh, well, wipe them off, how hard is that? Or sell it on ebay and buy the new matte brushedfinish Frieling. Gray powder on the inside? Not possible with 18/10 Stainless...has to be bad water or bad dishwashing detergent, come on, think of a better pot shot. Frieling's positive 4 & 5 star reviews are 94% of the total here. That is highly unusual on Amazon. So don't worry, the $75 is only about $10 more than the lesser Bodums you might be shopping. It is money well spent, lasting for many, many years. I cherish my Frieling, and so will you. THE COFFEE HOUSE FRENCH PRESS BREW METHOD: The Hows and Whys USE CLEAN, COLD WATER. Brewing with a French Press is simple and easy. You have to know how to do it and WHY you are doing it to extract the most flavor possible. Essentially, your water flavor must be good so you begin by using cold, filtered water. You fill your kettle with TWICE the water needed: half to prewarm your Press and the other half for brewing. USE THE RIGHT DOSE OF COFFEE BEANS. Dose coffee beans at 5565g of coffee beans per liter of water, or 70 grams if you \"break and clean\" (rather than stirring the bloom, you break the bloom foam cake and spoon out the surface grounds to reduce the fines, in which case you sacrifice some brewing grounds, so you need to overdose a bit).  Use a kitchen scale to measure. BEGIN GRINDING THE BEANS JUST BEFORE THE WATER BOILS. Once the bean husk is cracked open favor immediately escapes, so wait until the last minute to grind, just as the water begins to boil. I can recommend Baratza grinders, by the way. BREW AT THE CORRECT TEMPERATURE.  As the water almost boils, start your grinder, prewarm your Press with half the offboil water, empty the Press and fill with the grounds weighed on a scale. Then pour in the other half of the water, using a scale to measure, at about 205208 degrees F so as the temperature drops during the brew you are NEVER brewing lower than 195 degrees F. NEVER begin at 195 degrees F or flavor really suffers as the temp at brew's end can even drop to 185 degrees F...not good! BREW FOR THE CORRECT TIME. A fourminute brew cycle is highly recommended. Anything less gives you a raw, underextracted cup, anything more gives you an overcooked, overextracted, bitter cup. At Brew's end, ALWAYS pour out coffee into cups to terminate the brewing. NEVER store coffee in any coffee brewer as it will continue to brew! Even with drip brewing coffee is stored in a carafe...do that same here. A coffee brewer of any kind is NOT a coffee storage carafe. That is a job for a thermally insulated carafe. The insulation in a French Press is there to keep the brew at the correct temperature DURING the brew cycle. BREWING IT: An Upclose Look at Brewing French Press Coffee1. FILL KETTLE with at least TWICE the water needed to brew. Use only fresh, neverboiled, COLD, FILTERED water, not the nasty tasting, mildly rusty hot water sitting inside your hot water heater. Now begin heating your water at high heat.2. WEIGH YOUR BEANS. While the water heats, place your grinder's groundscollecting bin on your scales, then tare to zero. After weighing, pour the beans into the grinder's hopper, then place the grounds bin in the grinder to catch the grounds when you grind.3. GRIND YOUR BEANS. Set your grinder to a mid coarse setting, as coarse as coarsely ground pepper, and experiment to get the dosage just right for your taste...I like the finer side of coarse.  When your water almost boils, at about 210211 degrees F, turn off the heat and start your grinder and let the water temp drop a bit in the meantime.4. WEIGH WATER AS YOU POUR, THEN STEEP. While the grinder is grinding, pour hot water into your Press to warm it.  When the grinding is completed, pour the warming water from the Press into your cup(s) to prewarm them, discard remaining water from the Press. Then pour your coffee grounds to the Press and place your Press on your scales, tare the Press to zero. To monitor heat place a thermometer in your Press. Now pour in the kettle's remaining 205208 degree F water into the Press as shown on your scale (I use 870900g in my 1 liter Press). Place the lid on the Press with plunger extended upward to begin the brewing cycle. Set your timer to 4 minutes.5. STIR, SINK, OR SCOOP OFF THE BLOOM. After after one minute, either gently stir, or sink the bloom with a spoon, or remove (break) the cake \"crust\" with a soup spoon (or two) to gently scoop to remove (clean) the bloom off the top to reduce the amount of fines in the brew. Be sure no grounds remain above the plunger or in the spout as those grounds will end up in your cup.6. REPLACE THE LID AND FINISH BREWING. With the lid on, continue to brew until the timer beeps, then press the plunger down VERY SLOWLY to the bottom (to reduce agitation of any fines present). Pour out the warming water from your cup(s), THEN pour in the hot coffee from the Press to replace it. Serve and enjoy. This is the ambrosia people are talking about...properly made French Press. Note: Hoping to cover all the bases, and to eliminate any confusion, I have gone into great detail here so you know not only HOW to properly make French Press, but also WHY you make it that way. Making French Press is actually a very simple ritual once you do it a few times, much, much simpler than it appears in the above. NOTE: The French Press pictured above is the highly regarded doublewalled insulated Frieling Ultimo French Press made of 100% 18/10 stainless steel with a stainless steel lid and parts..no plastic parts in the lid or filter plunger. The Frieling is a fine hotel and restaurant grade product available in five sizes. Available in mirror polished or brushed matte finishes.

      "\"One chews coffee beans while gargling 200 F water for four minutes; pressing with the tongue, coffee is filtered through the teeth: is this the French press you refer to?\"  M. PythonAN INTRODUCTION TO COFFEE AMBROSIA. It's a quest for flavor. It's all about flavor. You are here searching for the best quality French Press, one that delivers the most flavorful coffee possible. You might be new to French Press and are rightly skeptical about the vulnerability and safety of a glass model. Or, you might be experienced, a Bodum or BonJour refugee exasperated by having to replace your second, or third, or even your seventh broken glass beaker. No cuts? Lucky you. Been there. Below: First is a look at buying a French Press, followed by a Review of the Frieling French Press, then info on grinders, accessories, buying coffee, and brewing the best French Press. SHOPPING FOR A FRENCH PRESS: WHAT TO LOOK FORFIRST, WHAT IS FRENCH PRESS? Call it French Press, Press Pot, Cafetiere, Plunger Pot, Pressed Coffee, Coffee Press, or Cafe a Piston, it is all the same. Invented by an Italian man, popularized in France, \"French Press\" has emigrated to North America. The apparatus itself is strikingly simple: A handled pot, a lid, and a plunger. A French Press can be made of glass, metal, plastic, or ceramic. The pot is never placed on a stove burner...hot water is poured over ground coffee and steeped a few minutes, the plunger is pressed down, the brewed coffee is then poured into cups. French Press is a handson brewing method that allows the user to control brewing variables, adjusting for personal taste. This is a fullimmersion brewing method where the bed of grounds can steep, or soak, for a few minutes prior to pressing to terminate the brewing, thereby remarkably intensifying the brew's flavors and aromas when properly brewed using proper equipment. Usually, coarsely ground coffee beans are poured into the Press followed by offtheboil water, allowed to steep about four minutes at the correct temperature, then the pistonlike, porous filter plunger is slowly pressed down to filter and separate the grounds from the brewed coffee just prior to serving. A simple ritual indeed. In order to brew French Press you need a French Press. So, for shrewd shopping, French Press design features are discussed below...SIMPLICITY. No unnecessary parts means less parts to fail or to clean. ROBUST CONSTRUCTION: Your pot,lid and plunger should be of sturdy, durable construction using rustfree metals such as foodgrade stainless steel, high impact, BPAfree plastics, borosilicate glass, or quality ceramics with foodsafe glazes. The most durable, heavyduty quality is heavyduty restaurant/hotel commercial grade rather than the far less durable, lightduty consumer grade. INSULATION: Coffee Science has confirmed that coffee should be brewed at between 195 and 205 degrees F during the ENTIRE brewing cycle to release as much flavor and aroma as possible. The brewing cycle is usually four minutes for French Press. To keep temperatures within this range during the brewing cycle requires an INSULATED French Press. French Press designs that will do so are: thermal doublewall stainless or glass, thickwall ceramic designs, or inexpensive \"thermos\" designs. A heads up: An INSULATED French Press is a dedicated coffee BREWER, and is NOT a coffee storage vessel designed to store coffee after brewing...therefore it should NOT be confused with an INSULATED \"thermos,\" a design dedicated only to STORING hot or cold beverages. So, after brewing, immediately pour ALL coffee into cups or into an insulated thermos. This will immediately terminate brewing to avoid overextraction, producing a bitter cup. DISHWASHER SAFE. Ensure that your Press is dishwasher safe, and is easy to clean if handwashed. Look for hidden corners or crevices. Insist on dishwasher safe highheat resistant materials. EFFECTIVE FILTER. Your plunger's filter screen, the metal mesh, must filter, or separate, coffee grounds from the brewed coffee. The finer the screen the better it does so, BUT, and I mean the BIG BUT...no matter how good your grinder is, or your filter, some very fine particles will always make it through the filter, ending up at the bottom of your cup. It cannot be helped. Why?Because if the screen is too fine, almost solid, all grounds might be filtered out, but then it might be impossible to push the plunger to the bottom because of the resistance encountered when coffee cannot pass through the filter, yet if the filter screen is too porous then the amount of \"fines\" coming through the filter screen will markedly increase. The solution?Aside from optimal filter porosity, a quality burr grinder is key in reducing to a minimum the amount of \"fines\" coming into your cup. Even still, do not take the last sip...a bit of silt in the cup is a French Press thing...part of its reality, part of its pleasure...the price you pay for excellence in the cup. COMFORTABLE, SECURE HANDLE. You need a comfortable, secure, insulated handle. Look for a handle with a horizontal grip for the thumb and clearance for the fingers. Your handle should stay cool, especially when pouring. Its grip design should be comfy and encourage a confident, accurate pour. STABLE POT. Your Press should be stable enough to resist accidental tipping when struck: A Press can have tall proportions IF the weight is substantial. A base smaller that the width at any point is not a good design. DRIPLESS SPOUT. Your French Press should never drip or dribble when pouring...return it if it does so. Good design prevents that. SAFE TO USE. Your Press must be safe to use when not fully awake in the morning. As you know, accidents and fumbles can happen, so avoid materials that might shatter, crack, or injure you, as well as needing replacement. Only foodgrade 18/5 or the better 18/10 stainless steel should be used. Glass beakers should be highheat resistant, Pyrex type borosilicate glass. If plastics are used, ensure that they are foodsafe, BPAfree, and are not porous enough to harbor bacteria (or harbor stale coffee tastes and aromas). If ceramics are used, ensure that the glazes are food safe, cadmium and cobaltfree, or FDA approved. MATCHING YOUR FRENCH PRESS SIZE TO YOUR DESIRED COFFEE SERVING SIZEBUY THE RIGHT SIZE FOR YOUR DESIRED SERVING SIZE : When brewing fill the press no higher than an inch or more from the brim, or to the V at the bottom of the spout. This reduces capacity, but prevents coffee ejecting from the spout when pressing down. Room MUST be allowed for the halfinch to oneinch thick CO2 caused foamy \"bloom\" to rise, the water displacement of the plunger and spillage room. Do not forget the volume of the grounds either, and the 24 ounces of water retained by the grounds after pouring. Because of the facts mentioned above, any \"tothebrim\" capacity claimed by the maker must be adjusted downward by at least 26 fl. oz., in proportion to the size of the press. This goes for ALL brands and models of French Press products. For example, Frieling's stated capacities are often confusing and not clearly defined, so you might need to contact Freiling to ask questions prior to purchase, or read the below. Do so when shopping Bodum, BonJour, Frieling, or any brand of French Press. To eliminate confusion, you need to know the actual, always lesser, YIELD of served coffee in fluid ounces, not the maximum capacity, to the brim, of the French Presses you are comparing. If in doubt, go larger. A REVIEW OF THE FRIELING FRENCH PRESSPROS:1) FRIELING OWNERS HERE ON AMAZON VOTE IT 4.7 STARS, 94% POSITIVE. You might have noticed that only a few products on Amazon are rated that highly.2) FRIELING MAKES FIVE SIZES FOR YOUR DESIRED PORTION SIZE. Frieling's stated sizes are at full capacity, but it is prudent to reduce that maximum capacity by about 26 fluid ounces, depending upon the size chosen, to allow space for the plunger and the inevitable rising head of bloomfoam when hot water hits the ground coffee. Accordingly, Frieling makes FIVE sizes to suit your capacity needs: 8 fl/oz, 16 fl/oz, 23 fl/oz, 36 fl/oz, and 44 fl/oz.3) DOUBLEWALL THERMAL INSULATION. Frieling makes only one model, the Ultimo, in polished or brushed finish. ALL its three main elements are hollow, doublewall insulated: the pot, the handle, AND the lid. So far, it is the only brand or model of French Press, with one exception, to possesses ALL three featuresthe insulated LID in particular. Such insulation will keep your brewing coffee at 195205 degrees F during the entire brewing cycle resulting in maximum flavor and aroma, as verified by the Specialty Coffee Association of America. FrielingUSA states that such insulation retains heat four times longer than a glass French press.4) 18/10 STAINLESS, COMMERCIALGRADE DURABILITY. Unique to Frieling, this heavy duty French Press is made of food grade, foodsafe solid stainless steel, 18/10 (18% chromium, 10% nickel: best quality), heavy gauge stainless steel stock. This quality, special alloy is foodsafe and leadfree, meant for commercial use in hotel roomservice and hotel dining rooms, for finecuisine restaurants, for caterers, and is sold to specialty, highend hotel/restaurant supply houses (still Frieling's primary business). Such high quality steel NEVER rusts or stains, and I mean NEVER. Also, it will never shatter or injure you. Survives dishwasher hell, and comes out looking like new. The Frieling was once under the radar. It is now available to the public at better coffeeware or kitchenware stores, and is available here on Amazon, far from its industrial roots. The interior is brushed, and because the stainless walls are solid all the way through, the plunger cannot scratch off any \"coating\" because there is no coating...so nothing can rust...as so many other reviewers here have confirmed. Neither the high speed metal brushed finish nor the mirror finish will affect its nonrust qualities...it is just a cosmetic thing.5) ITS FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION. Discipline and restraint, with utility in mind, results in the Frieling's handsome, elegant, and understated lines. Appearance has been given a slight nod. It's all business. Even its high polish is not there to WOW at, but to make it easier to clean. There are no false touches present; only the authentic remains. The entire achievement makes it presentable for casual entertaining, even for more formal occasions. A matching sugar and creamer, with spoon, is available. Its tall, slightly narrow profile has a small footprint, taking up little space on the counter or the table. Shopper's note: Confusing an insulated Press with an insulated carafe is a very common blunder. ANY brand of thermal insulated French Press is specifically designed as a brewer, NOT as a thermal carafe or thermos, so brewed coffee MUST be poured into cups IMMEDIATELY after the four minute brewing period or the continued steeping will produce, even if over a minute, an overextracted, bitter, and insipid cup! For leftover coffee, use a preheated thermal carafe or thermos, with a screwon sealed lid, specifically designed to store hot coffee, and to keep it hot, after it is brewed. Actually, it is best not to store coffee. Consume coffee within 1015 minutes for the best flavor. For more coffee simply brew more coffee for the best flavor.6) THE POT'S SMALL SPOUT is dripless due to its lipped design. Not a stray drop on the tablecloth yet after four years of daily use. The spout is small enough to lose minimal heat, and I tested the heat loss by plugging the spout with window pane putty and measured only a one degree F heat loss compared to an open spout when brewing. It therefore needs no mechanism to close the spout. You will discover that the spout is large enough for a quick, steepstopping pour.7) THE INSULATED LID is entirely unique. It is, with one exception, the only INSULATED lid for a French Press to be found by any manufacturer. Heat rises, and as far as heat is concerned, the pot functions as a chimney, focusing heat above, and its opening is where most heat is lost. This lid caps the heat with its tight fit and insulation. The lid's underside dome shape helps assist in that, like a domed teakettle. The overall lid design is critical if you care to brew at the proper 195205 degree F temperature. THIS WAS THE FINAL KICKER IN MY DECISION TO CHOOSE THE FRIELING, along with the other goodies.8) THE INSULATED HANDLE is crafted of hollow, extruded stainless, all of a piece, to keep it cool, as well as to keep it llight weight so as not to unsteady the pot. The handle's vertical upright is ovoid in crosssection to provide comfort for the gripping fingers. A secure niche for the thumb is provided with its horizontal thumb rest and thumbblock. An often overlooked feature in cup or French Press design, because if the thumb rests on on a horizontal support, especially if that support is provided with a means of blocking the thumb from slipping off, one's grip is then very secure indeed. Take a look at the photo of the handle on this site, you'll see it. The long, vertical provides plenty of clearance for the fingers, and is angled inward toward the bottom to secure the fingers, also to provide good leverage when pouring.9) THE PLUNGER, when pushed down, results in a dynamic turbulence that agitates the water and grounds to intensify flavors...this is the heart of the Press, and what makes French Press what it is. It also separates the grounds from the coffee, so it is fitted to precise specifications to minimize stray grounds coming through the filter or from between the pot's inner walls and the periphery of the plunger, and thence into the cup. The unit is entirely crafted from 18/10 stainless steel (the best grade)...no plastic parts to retain stale tastes whatsoever. Easy to dissemble for cleaning and spare parts are always available. Remember, with ANY French Press you will have stray grounds, especially if you buy canned coffee because it is always ground too fine for French Press, or if you use anything but a burr grinder. Even so, tiny grounds sneak in...French Pressists never sip that last sip: don't blame the Frieling Press, or a Bodum, or a BonJour.10) REPLACEMENT PARTS AND EXCHANGES FOR VALID PROBLEMS ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE. My online and telephone experience with Frieling USA has been excellent. They will replace any product or part you feel is defective. Also, down the line, parts such as the filter screen. cross plate, spiral plate of the plunger assembly, or the plunger rod, are available at very reasonable prices.11) FRIELING KEEPS GOOD COMPANY. Beside Amazon, the finest, most prestigious online coffee gear retailers carry it: cateringplanet, wholelattelove, seattlecoffeegear, clivecoffee, terroircoffee, williamssonoma, espressozone, shop. illy, chriscoffee, liquidplanet, roaste, crateandbarrel, coffee. become, coffeebydesign, coffeeart, veniacoffee, greentreecoffee, blacksmithcoffee, wayfair, etc.12) USEFUL FOR MAKING \"OPEN POT\" COFFEE. You can also use this for \"OPEN POT\" brewing, the simple, \"connoisseur's method,\" also called \"Cowboy Coffee.\" With this method, you simply dose a pot with coffee, pour in offboil water, and steep with the lid on, but with the plunger extended just, stir three times during the steep, after the four minute steep pour through a fine filter into your cup. The flavor is similar to French Pressed coffee.13) USEFUL AS AN INSULATED SERVING PITCHER FOR HOT OR COLD DRINKS. Use the Freiling for serving cold juices, milk, or ice water; use it for serving hot syrup, hot chocolate, hot milk, etc.14) EASY TO CLEAN. The Freiling is dishwasher safe and that will remove any water spots or fingerprints with ease. The plunger filter assembly does not need to be taken apart to clean. Handwashing is often used when camping. Coffee oils build up on grinders and coffee makers of any kind...same here. So, periodically, when you see a thin brown film, use a watervinegar solution and let soak overnight, then scrub well. CONS:1) THE LID CAN SLIP FORWARD A BIT WHEN POURING: The lid is snug for pressing, but while pouring, the lid can slip forward a half inch or so. Solutionthe \"teapot pour\", the way waitstaff use it: with the finger(s) of one hand, lightly press down on the lid, the other hand grips the handle to pour. Or, use the \"onehand pour\": grip the handle with your fingers, press down lightly with side of your thumb upon the flat of the lid's back edge, or use the index finger as another reviewer here mentioned, then pour...easy and secure. If you are extremely heatsensitive just use a potholder to hold to lid. I never need to, and neither do my Frieling French Press using friends, including my daughter.2) A FEW SMALL PARTICLES OF GRIND CAN CATCH IN THE PLUNGER, in the tiny screen seam. SolutionIf that happens, then after brewing and rinsing out your Frieling, fill with hot water, replace lid and plunger. Then, pumping vigorously up and down a few times, the turbulence removes the particles. I seldom have to do that twice or use a small brush. Then place the pot and plunger in the dishwasher.3) FRIELING'S SIZING IS CONFUSING CUSTOMERS: Capacities of Frieling's presses are often expressed in two capacities: he \"serving\" capacity and the \"maximum capacity\" when used as a serving carafe for liquids other than coffee. Very often the \"serving capacity\" is not accurate, serving less than the amount stated. Moreover, various vendors, Amazon sellers, and other retailers list the same model at different capacities. It is maddening. Not only that, but most customers do not know that the \"cups\" Frieling and all coffee manufacturers refer to are actually the European \"Tasse\" cup of 4.22 fluid oz each (1/8 liter, 125ml), NOT the US 8oz measuring cup, so customers often feel misinformed when coffee servings are HALF what they expected. Frieling is innocent of misrepresentation here: it is customer ignorance that is at fault. Regardless, Frieling needs to address this issue ASAP and give us the ACTUAL YIELD per serving, in US fluid ounces, of each size offered. CONCLUSIONThe Frieling French presses are a commercial, industrial design with commercialgrade stainless, insulated everywhere, including the lid, easier to clean than with plastic parts that also retain flavors. Holds the brew temperature at the correct SCAA recommended 195205 degrees, the most important brewing feature of all. Dishwasher hardy and cleanup is easy. Handsome and presentable for entertaining. Durable to the maximum. Excellent, all stainless plunger, few stray particles, produces minimal silt. Highly recommended. 4.8 Amazon stars.

LA CAFETIERE THERMIQUE 8c, $35, 4.2 stars: NO plastics, INSULATED LID, drips, MIXED REVIEWS, stable. P.S. Most of the above brands and models, Bodum and BonJour in particular, I respect for their overall quality, if not for the plastic parts. They, and Frieling, all make similar coffee, but with varying degrees of insulation efficiency and thus very noticeable flavorintensity outcomes. Being consumergrade products, they are not expected to be as durable as commercialgrade equivalents, such as Frieling, due to their intended work environment. Consequently, their comparison with the Frieling is a bit unfair...like comparing apples to oranges. Always buy commercial products whenever possible...the tough guys. By the way, if you remain loyal to glassbeakered Presses, the doubleglass wall, insulated version of the iconic Bodum Chambord 8c ($80) is available (being that glass holds in heat better than metal, I can recommend it), but a replacement beaker is $50, $130 total Amazon. If insulation is not important to you, the glass beakered, single walled, Bodum Eileen ($67 Amazon for the 8c), with its \"full metal perforated jacket\" of stainless, is widely used in French restaurants and bistros as a commercial Press; it is fairly durable for a single wall Press due to the metal sheath, but its single wall will NOT keep the brew at the right temperature. A REBUTTAL OF THE MOST COMMON CRITICAL REVIEWS, AND SOME OVER THE TOP ONESTHE COMMON ONES1) \"Some grounds and silt bypass the filter and are in my cup.\" Answer: some will always pass through, it is a French Press thing, common to all brands and models...French Pressists never take that last sip. But there are three ways to dramatically reduce that, 1) the fault, almost invariably, USING A WHIRLYBLADE GRINDER, or the LACK OF A CONICAL BURR GRINDER that allows you to grind EVENLY and COARSELY, no more dustandboulders; or b) not grinding COARSELY enough with any grinder; or c) buying CANNED OR PACKAGED PREGROUND coffee ground FINE for drip coffee so that fine grounds can bypass the French Press's filter. Grind mediumcourse for French Press, not\" fine. If you have no good grinder then have your coffee source grind it coarsely for you.2) \"My coffee does not stay hot very long after I pour it.\" Answer: ANY brand of French Press is designed to BREW coffee, and NOT TO STORE IT. Period. Stainless Steel, or glass, doublewalled Presses are designed to keep the brewing coffee at the correct temperature (195205 degrees) DURING THE BREW CYCLE and are NOT MEANT TO STORE COFFEE AFTER THE BREW CYCLE IS COMPLETED. If the steep goes much past 4 minutes you get nasty coffeeoverextracted and bitter. I am convinced that the confusion comes from mistaking what it looks like: an insulated pot \"looks\" like a thermos, or insulated carafe. Well, it's not. It's a brewer. Timing is critical when making any coffee. Espresso Baristas use a timer to cut short their pull at 2530 seconds per shot, with French Press (and drip) set your timer to 3.5 to 4.5 minutes per extraction (4 minutes is the sweet spot).3)\"I get this metallic taste (or bitter taste, or stale taste, take your pick).\" Stainless steel, especially foodgrade 18/10 stainless used in the Frieling, is famed for imparting ZERO taste to food or beverages. It's what it's known for. The offtastes come from other sources such as, a) coffeol oil and collagen residues adhering to the Press wall, or in your grinder, or both...keep them clean, or 2) certain coffees give off unusual flavor notes also, or c) your water might be less than ideal, or d) your dishwash detergent is not thoroughly rinsed off. It's NOT the metal itself. THE OVERTHETOP ONES\"The handle breaks off,\" or \"has a sloppy weld.\" Or, \"Cannot clean the thing at all.\" Or, \"I get gray powder on my paper towel when I wipe it out.\" Answer: These are over the top, spoiler, dealkilling statements and are intended to be so, for various malicious reasons, I remain convinced, and so utterly lacking in truth that they are laughable. The laserweld on the handle is so secure that the restaurant supply managers I personally know say they have never experienced any handle failures or sloppy welds, none, ever. Dirty Stainless is not 18/10 stainless's fault, so if really neglected use foodservice's favorite: Barkeeper's Friend, use it gently, rinse. Lastly...\"It shows fingerprints all the time, and spots\"...uh, well, wipe them off, how hard is that? Or sell it on ebay and buy the new matte brushedfinish Frieling. Gray powder on the inside? Not possible with 18/10 Stainless...has to be bad water or bad dishwashing detergent, come on, think of a better pot shot. Frieling's positive 4 & 5 star reviews are 94% of the total here. That is highly unusual on Amazon. So don't worry, the $75 is only about $10 more than the lesser Bodums you might be shopping. It is money well spent, lasting for many, many years. I cherish my Frieling, and so will you. THE COFFEE HOUSE FRENCH PRESS BREW METHOD: The Hows and Whys USE CLEAN, COLD WATER. Brewing with a French Press is simple and easy. You have to know how to do it and WHY you are doing it to extract the most flavor possible. Essentially, your water flavor must be good so you begin by using cold, filtered water. You fill your kettle with TWICE the water needed: half to prewarm your Press and the other half for brewing. USE THE RIGHT DOSE OF COFFEE BEANS. Dose coffee beans at 5565g of coffee beans per liter of water, or 70 grams if you \"break and clean\" (rather than stirring the bloom, you break the bloom foam cake and spoon out the surface grounds to reduce the fines, in which case you sacrifice some brewing grounds, so you need to overdose a bit). Use a kitchen scale to measure. BEGIN GRINDING THE BEANS JUST BEFORE THE WATER BOILS. Once the bean husk is cracked open favor immediately escapes, so wait until the last minute to grind, just as the water begins to boil. I can recommend Baratza grinders, by the way. BREW AT THE CORRECT TEMPERATURE. As the water almost boils, start your grinder, prewarm your Press with half the offboil water, empty the Press and fill with the grounds weighed on a scale. Then pour in the other half of the water, using a scale to measure, at about 205208 degrees F so as the temperature drops during the brew you are NEVER brewing lower than 195 degrees F. NEVER begin at 195 degrees F or flavor really suffers as the temp at brew's end can even drop to 185 degrees F...not good! BREW FOR THE CORRECT TIME. A fourminute brew cycle is highly recommended. Anything less gives you a raw, underextracted cup, anything more gives you an overcooked, overextracted, bitter cup. At Brew's end, ALWAYS pour out coffee into cups to terminate the brewing. NEVER store coffee in any coffee brewer as it will continue to brew! Even with drip brewing coffee is stored in a carafe...do that same here. A coffee brewer of any kind is NOT a coffee storage carafe. That is a job for a thermally insulated carafe. The insulation in a French Press is there to keep the brew at the correct temperature DURING the brew cycle. BREWING IT: An Upclose Look at Brewing French Press Coffee1. FILL KETTLE with at least TWICE the water needed to brew. Use only fresh, neverboiled, COLD, FILTERED water, not the nasty tasting, mildly rusty hot water sitting inside your hot water heater. Now begin heating your water at high heat.2. WEIGH YOUR BEANS. While the water heats, place your grinder's groundscollecting bin on your scales, then tare to zero. After weighing, pour the beans into the grinder's hopper, then place the grounds bin in the grinder to catch the grounds when you grind.3. GRIND YOUR BEANS. Set your grinder to a mid coarse setting, as coarse as coarsely ground pepper, and experiment to get the dosage just right for your taste...I like the finer side of coarse. When your water almost boils, at about 210211 degrees F, turn off the heat and start your grinder and let the water temp drop a bit in the meantime.4. WEIGH WATER AS YOU POUR, THEN STEEP. While the grinder is grinding, pour hot water into your Press to warm it. When the grinding is completed, pour the warming water from the Press into your cup(s) to prewarm them, discard remaining water from the Press. Then pour your coffee grounds to the Press and place your Press on your scales, tare the Press to zero. To monitor heat place a thermometer in your Press. Now pour in the kettle's remaining 205208 degree F water into the Press as shown on your scale (I use 870900g in my 1 liter Press). Place the lid on the Press with plunger extended upward to begin the brewing cycle. Set your timer to 4 minutes.5. STIR, SINK, OR SCOOP OFF THE BLOOM. After after one minute, either gently stir, or sink the bloom with a spoon, or remove (break) the cake \"crust\" with a soup spoon (or two) to gently scoop to remove (clean) the bloom off the top to reduce the amount of fines in the brew. Be sure no grounds remain above the plunger or in the spout as those grounds will end up in your cup.6. REPLACE THE LID AND FINISH BREWING. With the lid on, continue to brew until the timer beeps, then press the plunger down VERY SLOWLY to the bottom (to reduce agitation of any fines present). Pour out the warming water from your cup(s), THEN pour in the hot coffee from the Press to replace it. Serve and enjoy. This is the ambrosia people are talking about...properly made French Press. Note: Hoping to cover all the bases, and to eliminate any confusion, I have gone into great detail here so you know not only HOW to properly make French Press, but also WHY you make it that way. Making French Press is actually a very simple ritual once you do it a few times, much, much simpler than it appears in the above. NOTE: The French Press pictured above is the highly regarded doublewalled insulated Frieling Ultimo French Press made of 100% 18/10 stainless steel with a stainless steel lid and parts..no plastic parts in the lid or filter plunger. The Frieling is a fine hotel and restaurant grade product available in five sizes. Available in mirror polished or brushed matte finishes.

      "Even though I was wild over the fact that I was going to have a Roomba 880 cleaning my house, it wasn't love at first sight.  In fact, for a while I was quite disgusted with the whole process.  What I needed to do was take my time and learn to work with the Roomba and get to know its capabilities.  After a few weeks we've both settled in and things are working out quite nicely.  Fabulously actually. My mistake was expecting more of the Roomba 880 than perhaps it was capable of.  There were things I needed to learn about from working with the Virtual Wall / Lighthouse to maintenance.  I didn't think I needed the Virtual Wall, but once I figured out how to use it I was quite pleased with the result. For several days I was not a happy camper.  In the back of my mind I was thinking that if the Roomba 880 was a maid, he or she would be taking a hike.  I ran up and down the stairs checking on the cleaning progress, which appeared to be between zero and none.  the darn thing seemed to be cleaning in a willy nilly fashion and kept getting stuck.  My Electrolux Silverado Deluxe canister vacuum seemed quite advanced in comparison. The Roomba got stuck on the corner of a large rug, got hung up on a pine room separator, and fell a few times.  It took a short tumble into the bathroom and when it went from the kitchen into another one.  My son said that the Roomba 880 had Cliff Sensors and shouldn't do that.  If you have a house built in 1840 like mine, some of the construction will defy any AI bot in the world and it did.  Later, when I set up a Virtual Wall, these issues were taken care of.  FYI, the tumble in the kitchen was due to the dark, slick surface of the floor and the rounded molding. I was not happy, my cat was totally freaked, but slowly things began to turn around.  I noticed that Liam Neeson (yeah, I named my Roomba 880 after him) began to do things that I liked.  That really fine pet dander, dust and hair began disappearing from my floors and rugs.  Things became cleaner and cleaner, and yes, I became much more capable of working with Liam. The Silverado still has its purpose and won't be retired just yet.  Those wide pine boards need help and try as he might, Liam can't get under the couch.  Instead of disgust, I've slowly grown to love my Roomba 880 and wonder what I ever did without it.  I really needed something to help me with dust and pet dander that set my allergies and asthma off big time. I've put together a video that I hope hits some major points, especially the part on maintenance.  It's not all encompassing, but will give everyone an idea as to what the Roomba 880 is all about.  I'll go over some of the particulars below to give a few extra pointers. I did register and name my Roomba 880.  I called customer service, got a number for tech and called them.  One ring and someone picked up  I had to think of something to ask so I inquired as to how to open my Lighthouse to insert the batteries (the picture in the manual is not for the 880).  I'm sure Delroy thought I was daft, but was patient and answered my question.  Thank you, Delroy for not laughing (I thought he was going to).  I received a couple of emails and now I know that Roomba cares for the customer and will go the extra mile.  I will be receiving two extra filters for registering Liam Neeson, have exquisite service, and now have a much cleaner house. The iROBOT ROOMBA:   Setting the Language:This is quite an easy process, but if you don't understand what the Roomba 880 is trying to tell you, it can be problematic. I have encountered some error messages and need to have them in a language I can understand. You simply remove the Roomba 880 from the charging dock.  Press the Dock button continually for a few seconds.  This would be what's called a \"long press\" if you were working with a Bluetooth device. Lightly tap the center Clean button until you hear the language you prefer.  There are sixteen languages:  English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, Polish, Russian, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, or Chinese.  Once you have made your selection, hold the Clean button for a few seconds and it will set.   The Cleaning Pattern / Cleaning Modes:At first I thought Liam was not all there if you know what I mean, but finally figured out how to set the patterns and use a Virtual Wall (there are two in the box).  Essentially there are two patterns the Roomba 880 follows, Spiraling and Wall Following. The Spiraling can be set by either tapping Spot on the face of the Roomba 880 or on the remote.  When Liam began to spiral, the cleaning seemed much more controlled.  It spirals outward in a three foot circle and goes back to where it started.  It's a more concentrated way to work on a specific area, especially if you have an unexpected spill you want cleaned up. The Wall Following method is the one that appears to be willy nilly, but it actually isn't. To set this you either tap the Clean button on the Roomba 880 or once again, on the remote.  I can easily see that continued cleaning can lead to a specific pattern, but because my household continually changes, I don't have one (yet).  If you don't want that pet bowl shoved against the wall or your fine furniture banged around, you will need to set up one or more of your Virtual Walls (more on that later).I most certainly learned that Liam didn't like clutter and wanted it out of the way.  In time it was easy to look at a room and know what needed to be removed or moved.  If it couldn't be removed or I didn't want Liam to go past a certain area, I used a virtual wall. If you want, you can schedule a cleaning.  I wouldn't suggest trying this until you are quite familiar with the way the Roomba 880 works.  Once you schedule, the Roomba 880 will leave at your prearranged time and return to Home Base when done.  I much prefer moving Liam from room to room because I'm home most of the time and find I can \"supervise\" more.   Cleaning System:There are apparently several changes between the old and new Roombas, but because I never owned one, I can't speak from experience.  I do know that people were quite annoyed by the brushes that worked well, but became entangled with hair.  That isn't happening when Liam cleans.  There is some hair and fiber wound along the edges of the extractors, but they do not interfere with the cleaning provided I do periodical maintenance. The AeroForce Performance Cleaning System. This is where the Roomba 880 breaks away from the old system and most likely has listened to what the customer wants and doesn't want.  I've heard a lot of people complaining about the old Roombas and the brushes.  They were like a throwback into the last century when there were carpet sweepers.  I know because I have one and still use it now and then.  The hair tangles in the brushes and needs to be either pulled out and cut and pulled out.  Following are the two changes. TangleFree Debris Extractors. These extractors are like rubberized tubes.  When Liam does his cleaning, no hair accumulated around them save on the edges.  There's a bit of tangle, but when I remove the extractors (a simple process) I just pick it off.  Each extractor has a different geometric shape on the end so there's no problem putting them back in.  I actually had to wash these off when Liam ran over something wet, but air dried them and put them back in. HighPowered Vacuum Channel. This supposedly has \"accelerated airflow through a seal channel.\"  I cannot tell you anything technical about this channel, but I must say Liam is picking up an amazing amount of very fine dust and dander, something I really need him to do.  When I open up the bin I'm quite pleased with what I'm finding.  Not that I enjoy looking at dirt, but better in the bin than in on my floors and carpets than in my lungs. Spinning Side Brush. When Liam is roaming along the side of a wall, I can see the little spinning side brush at work flipping dust bunnies where he can get at them.  If he misses on the first pass, he'll manage to get them on the next.  This side brush can be removed for cleaning.  I have yet to do so, but it can be removed via a coin or screwdriver. Floor Surfaces:I have hardwood floors, wide pine, laminates, and some carpeting.  Liam will roll up small throw rugs, but now I'm removing them prior to setting him to work.  He does well on all of these surfaces and one thing my son commented on was the fact that my wool oriental has some fluff to it.  Liam is now hard at work cleaning in between the fibers and actually making the rug look much better.  All other surfaces are an easyclean proposition.  I will need the Silverado to get in between the cracks on the wide pine. AntiTangle System. Now this in a really cool innovation.  At first I was hard at work moving cords out of the way when I didn't have to.  There's a sensor that lets Liam know about them.  A little blue indicator, which looks somewhat like a snowflake, begins to flash on the top.  I don't have to worry about Liam sucking up a cord.  I have yet to have anything become entangled in the extractors and I've ceased to worry about it.   Battery storage and charging. The battery life appears to be quite decent.  I can keep Liam working for long periods of time.  I'm making sure that I return him to the Home Base when not in use.  As with any battery, it needs to remain charged in order to work properly.  This is why it's important to charge up things like a PowerStation on a monthly basis.  If not, you've created the problem, not the Roomba 880.There's what's called a \"16Hour Refresh Charge\" if you don't have your Roomba 880 back on the Home Base in a reasonable amount of time.  There's an amber pulse to let you know it's in progress.  There are four different charging lights to let you know the charging progress. Just to make sure I've properly docked Liam on his Home base, I put him in front of it and press Dock and he drives himself home.  I don't have to worry whether or not I've gotten him in properly.  The Home Base also has a power light indicator.   Auto Virtual Wall. Some rooms have doors, but apart and aside from a bathroom door and one swinging door, I don't have any downstairs.  The little tumbles Liam takes are now avoided when I set up a Virtual Wall.  The Virtual Wall prevents him from crossing certain barriers, keeping him working where I want him to be.  No roaming allowed.  The manual will tell you everything you need to know about placement. When I called Roomba's Delroy, I wanted to know about putting the batteries in the Virtual Wall. It doesn't come apart like the illustration in the manual so don't try.  Turn the little yellow button on the bottom of the unit.  When you have the flat side pointing toward the bottom label, turn the whole Lighthouse / Virtual Wall right side up and the battery door will fall into your hand.  Roomba included all the batteries you'll need. There are no on / off switches to be had.  When you are using it you'll see a steady green light. Every now and then it will blip when Liam gets closer or just for the heck of it.  He's pushed the Virtual Wall out of the way a couple times, but I didn't have the Virtual Wall set up properly.  It's all a part of my learning curve and I'm doing quite well now.  Unless I'm missing something, there's no Auto Mode for the Roomba 880 Virtual Wall so don't go looking for one.  I'd suggest removing the batteries if you're not going to be using it frequently. I'm using the Virtual Wall right now as a matter of fact.  You don't have to necessarily put it in a doorway, but any area seven feet in diameter or less.  I piled some books up to block off one area and set up a Virtual Wall so Liam won't pester me when I'm typing.  Yes, he can be aggressive when he cleans and has just let me know he's done the area I asked him to do.   Virtual Wall Halo:This \"halo\" effect has come in quite handy.  For example, I have pets and along with them comes the water and food dishes.  Liam pushed them aside trying to clean and I ended up with a mess (mostly water everywhere).I had a couple of options:  One was to remove / move the bowls or set up a Virtual Wall in a halo mode.  One time I forgot to put the bowls back and kitty was upset.  Actually, setting up a Virtual Wall is much quicker, easier, and more efficient.  Setting one up to have your Roomba 880 to avoid certain \"treasures,\" furniture or whatever is a nice option.  Practice working with your Roomba before letting him or her loose. There's an intuitive button on the face of the Virtual Wall / Lighthouse.  You can have a narrow or nocross zone or a wider one.  It's rather like a threeway switch and can be adjusted accordingly.  The manual does have some visuals showing a proper way to set up a \"proactive zone\" and then one that won't work.  This is shown as a circular \"halo\"  that will prevent annoying messes.   Virtual Wall Lighthouse. The Lighthouse / Virtual Walls are housed in the same little robotlike enclosure.  There are two of them included with the Roomba 880.  On the face of the unite there's a switch you can use to change the mode.  Up for Lighthouse, down for Virtual Wall.  Similar to when I use the Virtual Wall, it will only come on when in use. There are a couple of cautionary notes about using one as a Lighthouse and the other as a Virtual Wall.  It can be done, but once again, I'd recommend practicing.  Signals can be crossed and your Roomba 880 may head back to the Home Base when you need him or her to clean. The Lighthouse is a navigational tool that will help guide your Roomba 880 through your house and ultimately back to the Home Base.  I'm not as familiar with this method so can't speak from experience.  I'm more for moving Liam around because I have a cat who roams and prefer to spook her as little as possible.   Home Base. Sounds a bit like baseball, but this is where Liam gets charged up when not in use.  A couple of things here.  You do need to keep it away from stairs (four feet / 1.2 meters)  for obvious reasons.  One other thing I noticed is that it should be placed against a wall. Liam will push the Home Base around in a struggle to dock.  It will move around when pushed and I suspect it could do that for quite some time.  If you are at home, it's easy to watch the process and correct the positioning of the Home Base.  I do like to dock by pressing the Dock button to make sure Liam is home safe and sound.   Remote Control. The remote is a simple affair, quite unlike your TV remote.  For one who is disabled and wants a bit of control, the remote is perfect.  I sat in my recliner the other day directing Liam.  There's a directional button, a Dock button, and Spot and Clean power buttons.  Quite intuitive and fun to work with. Action is a bit slow, but decent.  I had to keep in mind that Liam was not plotting a cleaning map, but did understand directions.  You have to remember that the same beam controls the Lighthouse / Virtual Wall so you need to put them aside if you decide to use the remote. There's an optional Wireless Command Center for the Roomba 880, but I don't have one and can't really comment on it.  It would be fun to have one I suppose, but I really don't think I'd need one as I can set everything I need.  I certainly wouldn't turn one down if offered, but don't think I'd actually purchase one.   Scheduling Roomba. Setting the Time. Setting up a schedule isn't difficult.  First you do have to set the time.  It's a threestep process. The Day, Hour, Minute, and OK buttons are above the cleaning buttons, but I'm going to describe it by using the cleaning buttons because this wording is just above the labeled buttons you'll be pushing. You press \"Clock\" button first (second button on the face).  Next pick the day by toggling the \"Dock\" button (first button).  Back to the \"Dock\" button to set the hour, move to the \"Schedule button\" to set the minutes, and when you are satisfied hit the \"Spot\" button. Setting a Schedule:Before you can even consider setting a schedule, you obviously need to set the time.  I've gone into that directly above this section.  I'm wearing out Liam by moving him around my house, but it I were working outside the home now, scheduling would be ideal.  If you have a twofloor home, it would be wise to move your Home Base to the floor you'll be scheduling on for the day(s).The Roomba 880 has a great memory and you can schedule up to seven times per week.  It's quite simple to set up a schedule.  Simply press on the schedule button, toggle the Day (1st button that has \"Dock\" above it), toggle through the times and make your selections. Deleting a Schedule:You can delete a schedule by pressing Day (1st button that has \"Dock\" above it), toggle until you find the scheduled time you want to delete, hold Day for several seconds until you hear a beep.  Gone. Changing the Schedule:Not such a difficult proposition to alter the schedule.  You simply press the Schedule button, press the Hour button (above Clock), and toggle to set the hour you want.  Move next to the the Minute button (above Schedule), toggle to set the minutes, and then press OK (above the Spot button).   Regular Maintenance. Maintenance is a given with anything like a vacuum, toaster, or the Roomba 880.  If you don't take a little care, it won't work as well as it could / should.  Things you'll need to clean or pay attention to wont' take a lot of time.  Believe me, it's easy once you've done it once. You'll need to work with the bin, filter, debris extractors, sensors (cliff and bin), the front wheel, the spinning side brush, the Roomba contact points, and the Home base points.  It's as easy as wiping something down or, in the case of the extractors, pulling them out and putting them back in after removing debris. Anything that has a touch of bumble bee yellow is meant to be removed.  Not too tough.  If you look at the ends of the extractors, you have two different shapes.  It's like a puzzle putting them back in.  You really can't miss, but be aware there is a difference here.  It can be frustrating to try to put one back if you don't know this. I'm using a microfiber cloth to touch up and clean things that can't be removed.  Once I became more experienced I'd say it didn't take more than five minutes to perform maintenance on everything. There is only one thing that will need periodic replacing and that's the HEPA filter in the bin.  I've noticed that it can be quite heavily covered with fine dander and dust.  Any parts can be found on Amazon.  Vendors change continually so I won't create links.   Other considerations. I did register and name my Roomba 880 to ensure I'd have that warranty.  I also named him at that time.  They are sending me a couple of filters for my efforts, something I do appreciate.  As I mentioned before, I made contact with customer service, which proved to be prompt, polite, and excellent. The manual is a physical one.  I'm thankful for that because although PDF files are nice, I can't take them with me when I'm in certain areas of the house trying to figure something out.  The manual is quite comprehensive with loads of visuals, something I most certainly appreciate and need. There's a troubleshooting guide, icons which indicate cautionary points, offer up tips, and generally will guide you through the gettingtoknowyourRoomba 880 phase.  Read them and pay attention. I've fallen in love with Liam and the work he has done and is capable of doing.  Now I'm thinking that I wouldn't mind having iRobots Brava and Scooba 450, but then again I really do need the exercise.\n",

      "Be warned: this is a LONG review (didn't realize HOW long when I first wrote it!), since I tried to hit all the main points of the Kaldi, but I'm hoping the surplus of info on each point proves helpful! Update I recently discovered that my local bed bath and beyond now carries these capsules (Virginia Peninsula region), which clearly makes it much easier to restock my favorite flavors. I was also happy to see that the capsules now include at least three new flavors: Hazelnut (regular and decaf), Butterscotch Toffee, and French Vanilla, all three being mildstrength flavored coffees. Additionally, I saw that the packaging has been changed on the French Vanilla and Dutch Cocoa powders, indicating to me that CBTL intends to continue to make these available, and push this product line. I consider that to be a GOOD thing, since this machine and the products that go with it provide a nice variety of hot beverage flavors!The CBTL Kaldi is the first singlecup brewer that I've owned from the new crop of singlecup brewers. I'd previously been using a Phillips Senseo machine with a few refillable pods that I bought here on Amazon, and loved. Being able to use my favorite coffee in those pods was great. The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf does, however, give Kaldi users plenty of options with this new addition to the current crop of highquality single brewers on the market. The coffee brewer has a small footprint, and a good, solid weight to it, even though it seems to be made of a heavy weight plastic. The platform on which the mug/espresso cup is meant to be placed is stamped metal, and can be flipped to bring a tiny espresso cup closer to the stream of coffee that is emitted from the front of the machine. Turning the platform over allows for about another 3/4 of an inch of depth  better for a standard mug, but not anywhere near enough clearance for the mondo mugs that have become so commonplace in today's world of coffee consumption. The one mug I use with my Kaldi fits perfectly. That mug's capacity is about 12 oz, stands about 4\" tall, and is about 3\" wide. None of my other mugs would fit under the spout, which I do consider to be a bit of a shortcoming of the Kaldi, but not a dealbreaker. The coffee itself that is brewed by the Kaldi is really very good, and very freshtasting. Unlike just about every other cup of coffee that I've brewed from nonencapsulated coffee, I really haven't noticed any issues with stomach upset due to acids from the coffee packaged in the Kaldi capsules. Maybe that's because of the tiny plastic filter inside each capsule, or it's the seal on the capsule (which keeps the capsule contents super fresh). Either way, you'll get no complaints from me about the freshness and lack of acid in my Kaldi cup o' Joe. I do, however, find the need to brew up a doubleserving of coffee with the Kaldi in order to get a large enough cup of Joe to satisfy my workday needs. At a minimum of $1.20, with each capsule approximating $.60 before shipping from the CBTL website, that can start to add up. Being on the East Coast, I don't remember ever seeing any Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf stores in my area, nor do the capsules seem to be carried yet in the stores, but both Amazon and the CBTL website carry them as of right now. Since I take my mug on the go with me to drink on the drive to work, after adding half & half from the fridge, my coffee is not warm enough for my tastes, so I nuke it for just under a minute, then head out. I noticed another reviewer mentioned that the temperature of the coffee is adjustable; the only thing mentioned about temperature in the manual is in the troubleshooting section, where it simply suggests that you heat the mug yourself if you want your coffee hotter, so the temperature of the brews is NOT adjustable, but I do like that you CAN adjust the quantity of water added to your cup. Also, I didn't have any difficulty with coffee spraying everywhere during my brewing cycles, nor did I have difficulties with especially long postbrewing drip, as mentioned in a different review. I've started to flush the system after just about every cup brewed, as another reviewer suggested, since I want my cups of brewed beverage to taste only like what I just brewed, not what was brewed last night. Also, speaking of flavor preservation, CBTL obviously felt it necessary to add a tank filter after their initial release of the Kaldi brewer, which I'm appreciative that they did. My filter was placed just inside the box, in a small plastic bag stapled to a card, and isn't even mentioned in the manual that comes with the brewer, so it's clear to me that it was an afterthought. And, as others have said, it DID occur to me immediately that anyone with less diminutive hands than mine would've had a harder time getting it in and attached to the bottom of the 40 oz water reservoir. Perhaps no one that's reviewed the Kaldi HAS had difficulty, but I thought it might be a problem, so just keep in mind that you may need some kitchen tongs or something to grip your filter and push it into place at the bottom of the tank. Overall, I really appreciate the wide variety of coffees, teas, and other beverage options available for this machine, even if I WILL have to be sure to order replacements before running out of my current stock. With fourteen options to choose from, you really can't complain too much about variety, so long as you don't already have your heart (or at least taste buds) firmly set on a specific brand/blend of the above. The available blends are as follows:Espressos (mildest to strongest):CBTL Continental Espresso Capsules By The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, 10Count Box (Pack of 3)Premium Decaf Espresso Capsules (also available on Amazon, but I've deleted the link to stay within review boundaries)CBTL Premium Espresso Capsules By The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, 10Count Box (Pack of 3)CBTL Italian Espresso Capsules By The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, 10Count Box (Pack of 3)Coffees (mildest to strongest):House Brew DECAF Coffee Capsules (also available on Amazon)CBTL House Brew Coffee Capsules By The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, 10Count Box (Pack of 3)CBTL Viennese Brew Coffee Capsules By The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, 10Count Box (Pack of 3)CBTL French Brew Coffee Capsules By The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, 10Count Box (Pack of 3)Teas:CBTL Moroccan Mint Tea Capsules By The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, 10Count Box (Pack of 3)CBTL English Breakfast Tea Capsules By The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, 10Count Box (Pack of 3)CBTL Tropical Passion Tea Capsules By The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, 10Count Box (Pack of 3)CBTL Chai Tea Capsules By The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, 10Count Box (Pack of 3)Powder Sachets (add to coffee to make it Cafe' Mocha or Cafe' Latte, to teas for a flavor shot with powdered creamer, or simply to warmed or frothed milk for hot chocolate or hot vanilla):The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf Chocolate Powder, 22Ounce Containers (Pack of 3) (not the sachets, but the same product, loose)or French Deluxe Vanilla (the only flavor not currently showing as available here on Amazon).If you're going to use this bundle for your hot chocolate or hot vanilla (if you will), the milk frother will come in very handy for that. The nonstick lining of the frother has demarcations for simple warmed milk or frothed milk. Keep in mind that frothed milk will have air whipped into it via the small wire whisk attached to the cover of the frother (increasing the volume of the added liquid), and simply fill the frother to the lower of the \"full capacity\" lines. A button push and ninety seconds later, you've got warm, frothy milk that's either perfect for adding to your coffee or tea, or ready to pour into your mug, to which you add one of the powder sachets for your chosen hot beverage. I haven't tried a hot vanilla yet, but the hot chocolate was very good, and very satisfying. Not necessarily better than other hot chocolates that I've had, but still, very tasty. I easily washed out the small amount of milk that was scalded to the lining, and my frother was ready for the next batch of milk. The tiny whisk is not difficult to detach if you simply want your milk warmed, but I'm concerned that the plastic base to it will wear out after too many attempts at removal and replacement of the whisk from its stem... Only time will tell if my concerns are founded. CBTL currently prices the powder sachets at $8.50 per box of eight. Capsules are $6.00 for a box of ten capsules. Not bad compared to the options for other singlecup brewers out there, but with limited local availability, and no free shipping visible from the CBTL website, your best bet is to place a big order and stock up once you've decided which of the flavors you like best from this bundle on Amazon. And, as a side note, unlike the Kaldi pictured, the model that I got is actually the blue one, which is a nice, middleofthe road shade of soft slate blue. With all that you get in this bundle on Amazon, you're saving quite a large amount of money compared to pricing other places. The machine itself prices at about $150. Tack on another $60 for the milk frother, then an additional 72 capsules at approximately $46, and you're looking at a bundle worth over $250, and that's not even including the cost of the wooden storage chest (which I didn't receive, but the closest approximation is the small capsule holder on the CBTL site, at $7.95). It's a great deal for a very good, small footprint hot beverage brewer that will easily give the other single cup brewers out there a run for their makers' money! Update  On my most recent visit to California, I tried finding the Kaldi capsules at two different The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf locations, with no luck. One of those locations WAS a smaller CBTL location inside of a local grocery store, but the other location that I visited was a standalone store that didn't stock any Kaldi capsules whatsoever, although each location DID stock the Cocoa and French Vanilla powders. Luckily, Amazon is now carrying the capsules, and at a good price. As is, the prices aren't much higher than you'll find on the CBTL website itself, so if you had to get them shipped from the CBTL website, with shipping costs, you'd still pay at least a little less here for them. If you opt for the Subscribe & Save feature that Amazon offers, you'll get the capsules for an additional 15% off, AND free shipping. Even though the Subscribe & Save price changes depending on product pricing the day of your order, and your Prime Free 2 day shipping upgrade won't apply, free standard shipping and 15% off saves you over the CBTL website's pricing.\n",

      "7/30/13 addendum:Still happy after using this vac for 1 year. Power head which is supposed to be used on carpets is fine to use on tiles, but I noted that it throws some of the dirt out from behind but if I use the regular head that doesn't happen. Strong suction that works better on carpet that any other vac I have tried. Would give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars because its not perfect but it's on top with my other favorite vacuum brands Miele and Vorwerk.11/2013PROS: Powerhead with removable brush and and additional small openingmake is easy to clean out pet hair or long hair the powerhead suction is so strong  on tiles I can see dirt lying 1\" next to the head getting sucked in long power cord (I can vacuum our 3 bedroom apartment without unplugging it) use it to clean your car by removing the brush using the hose adjustable height of handle comes with powerhead for lowhigh pile carpet, extra head for hardwood, tile flooring etc, hose extensiontool, couch/upholstery tool sealable bag (when you take it out the dirt stays in the bag) the head moves/swivels so you can get any angle you don't have to bend down super low to wind up the cable (because it's placement it higher than on othervacuums) a warning light turns on if something gets stuck ON/OFF switch & adjustable suction power are located on the handle adjustable suction power allows you to vacuum expensive or fine rugs that are very sensitive the powerhead it self has 4 adjustable levels that change the height between the ground and the head toallow sufficient airflow = cleaning power(4 is for high pile and 1 can be used on rugs or tilesCONS: it's not too heavy for me, but if you're looking for ultra light  this is not the right model for you this also doesn't bother me, but FYI with the powerhead on the noise increases slightlyUnfortunately I can't say anything about the durability of the vacuum yet since I haven't owned it long enough yet, but it has a 5 year warranty which most vacuums don't have. I bought the black model from a small local vacuum business for the same price (plus 1 free box of 10 bags) that you can find it for online (only 1 bag in the vacuum included I think)."

      "Some of the dining room chairs from the set purchased by my parents were sadly worn and I decided to buy these Armen chairs  oddly enough, although I ordered two sets on the same day, the first set was delivered by FedEx  they are a neutral cream color and fit nicely with any d&eacute;cor  I did find that the seat height is higher than my old dining room chairs so I (5' 3\") have to sit towards the front of the seat in order to have my feet flat on the floor  however, my son is happy as at 5' 11\", he can take full advantage of the lumbar support of the tall chair back Unfortunately, the second set of chairs was delivered by UPS  I gather that FedEx put the box containing the chairs in a larger cardboard box and while one side of the outside box was ripped, the box inside was not damaged at all  UPS just delivered the chairs in their original packing box and that was ripped in several places  when we moved the box into my living room, I could hear tinkling and when we opened the box, the bolts, washers and locks needed to assemble the seat and chair legs to the chair back were all over the inside of the box as the bag containing these articles had been slit  we gathered all the pieces and apparently some had fallen out through the rips in the packing box  I then had to go to a specialty fastenings store when Home Depot said they didn't carry these items (for anyone having the same problem, they are metric)  so after that hassle, we started assembling the second set of chairs when I noticed that the top of one chair back was torn  so, ended up having to rebox up all of the second set and just shipped them back (NEVER ask for a replacement  they will make you pay the shipping costs to return the item!)  I will update once the new set arrives  hopefully the second set will be delivered by FedEx and not UPS!Update 11/15/13  I've had to lower my rating down to two stars because this whole situation has been a trial  it was quite a hassle to get a free return shipping label for the second set of chairs  I did it on the chat route and the first person said I wouldn't have to pay for the return shipping and then sent me a shipping label which said that I would have to pay the return shipping cost!  I went on the chat site again and the second person said no problem, sent me a link to the free return shipping label  repacked everything and took it down to UPS and sent the chairs back. Then the third (replacement) set arrived yesterday evening.  I decided to wait until this morning to open the box and lo and behold, there is a 5\" stain on one of the chair seats  whoever packed it left a piece of oilstained tape stuck to the chair seat and I wasn't able to get the stain off  so I went online to the chat site again and this time, I wasn't able to get a free shipping label although I was told that I would be refunded the FULL cost of returning this set of chairs (I live in Hawaii and the amount that Amazon says they will refund you for shipping is nowhere close to the actual cost of what it costs to send these large items back) So I now only have two chairs and although I really like them, I don't know about submitting to another round of this  I am now trying to see if I can cancel the Smartgard protection plan I purchased for this second set of chairs since I don't seem to be able to get a set without any damage or defect  I guess I'll have to recover the seats of my old dining chairs and when I have the energy to deal with this hassle again, I MIGHT consider trying to reorder another set of chairs  if I have any problems with getting my full shipping costs refunded, there's no way I will order any large items from Amazon again!Update 11/30/13  Packed up the second set of chairs and was on my way down to the FedEx center on Saturday morning to send them back when I saw an email that had just come in on my phone that morning from the Amazon returns department that they had arranged to have UPS come to my home and pick up the box!! The UPS driver picked up the box the following Monday and I've since been notified that the set arrived and my refund will be credited to my account.  For that reason, I have upgraded my rating to three stars. So, decided to order two sets of chairs this time around and hoping that all goes well  it would be nice to have a full set of matching chairs for my dining room!\n",

So I have a probllem for I opened the curtain  as I said it is gorgeous  and no way I can fold it back the way it was .....however it too is so beautiful  the color I will save and later maybe when I get new shower hooks I will be sure it will fit this particular shower liner.....it is of excellent quality  heavy  it would have been beautiful with the lace shower curtains  however washing my old fabric liner which I bought at AMAZON  in white  it came out like brand new  and this white I was surprised  my bathroom which has no window  looks so bright  and I love it  both curtains and liner were from an exellent seller and a good price  came together in my PRIME SHIPPING with no charge.....so watch the hooks when purchasing curtains  and liners ......shipping arrived as promised  boxed appropriately and taped well  and by the way at this price I bought two of the curtains  and it makes it look luxurious  in particular when you have an older bathroom  my home is over  nearly 55 years old  and the bathroom while fixtures are newer  it is smaller  the other bathroom much larger  but the white gives it a brightness which seems to expand size of same......Amazon has the best buys ever....Connie  Thank you Seller and Amazon...\n",

Everything I have made has come out fabulous...I finally retired my old stainless steel pressure cooker after 15 years and the difference between my Instant Pot and the old way of pressure cooking is like day and night...The old one I just realized turned everything into mush ( various soups) after around 20 minutes or less of required cooking and I was used to it but the 6 in 1 is so much better...Thus far I have steamed asparagus amd artichokes to perfection, as well as brussel sprouts, potatoes and pears...I made chicken soup (with the regular soup setting) as well as Greek Lentil soup last night, and all have been delicious...with soft vegetables that still had definition to them, not all mushed up.....the only problem I experienced thus far was charring a pork roast and the bottom of the pot was burned but after soaking and cleaning with Bartenders Friend it cleaned up perfectly...This was my fault and it will not happen again....I look forward to using it...I noticed in the recipe book mostly all the recipes are times in the Manual setting, but thus far the soup setting works great for all types of soup....I use the manual settings for the vegetables and fruits....Anyway, the bottom line is I am very happy with this purchase and hope it will continue producing great meals!!!\n",
