I defy anyone to find another retailer that can match their price. comes with a 1year warranty and if LG is anything like GE (I have no idea) they won't bat an eye if you call them for service even when the appliance is a few years old More/Less. Arrows allow you to subtract or add time while the microwave is in operation. tells you when to turn over food, when you're defrosting. extra large cooking capacity, and with the wrack it nearly doubles in size 1100 watts of power. the Bad it is incredibly heavy and bulky (nearly 70 pounds), have at least 2 strong men who can lift it when you install it. the door makes a loud clunking sound when it closes. there isn't a 'quick cook' button like GE had, the closest this has is EZOn, however that automatically defaults to 30 seconds the unit. doesn't constantly keep beeping to remind you that your food is ready. sometimes foods tend to get slightly soggy when taken off the 'hold warm' setting. the rotation cannot be turned off if it is set to keep warm. it's doing a number on my plastic dishes that are microwave safe, they're slightly bending, however since they're so inexpensive I do not mind too much. the Ugly it is a beast to clean/keep clean. it is a fingerprint/dust magnet picks up streaks very quickly. it can pick up scratches very, very easily. the Exceptional the Soften button allows you to soften butter, icecream, cream cheese and even frozen juice with the cooking sensors. the microwave cooks everything to the perfect temp and then shuts off automatically, this is great for TV dinners. with the Reheat button you can quickly heat up anything and the microwave will bring it to the perfect temp without any effort on your part dedicated. defrost settings for vegetables, beef and chicken with the Hold Warm button. I can now leave whatever I was cooking in it for up to 90 minutes and it will stay nice and hot, this'll save on power because I won't have to turn on the oven for this. able to automatically turn on the Hold Warm feature to follow another cooking function. EZOn feature can be extended in 30 second increments just by pressing it. Custom Cook can be programmed to cook any single time you use the most often (my only complaint about this is you still need to press the Start/Enter button). Things to Remember never use a brillo pad or abrasive sponge on this as it could scratch very easily. although I don't know why you would want to, never turn the microwave oven on if nothing is inside it. when you first get it, sometimes it makes slight crackling sounds as it's in operation, these are normal when this arrives. it will look HUGE in the manufacturer's box, don't worry that's just how it looks in the box. If anyone has any suggestions on how to keep this looking perfect and nice and shiny and glossy please let me know.\"\n",

I am amazed at the speed of cooking and reheating it can do and Amazon has the best and lowest price of any website I researched on. oven has a clock which was not stated on the description on the amazon page where it is located on. there is however downfall to this microwave oven which I was very surprised to. have witnessed for such an innovator of this type of oven they are known for their carousel that it did not have a luud beep when the oven is finished cooking or reheating. you really have to be in a room that is very quiet to hear this beeping sound for when the oven is finished. but all in all great oven great price and lots of cooking and reheating settings and loads of interior space. I was even able to put a Visions cookware pot in there without damaging the sides of the oven while the turntable is in motion which I thought I would not be able to do prior to receiving the oven. I did have a concern that I would not be able to use this particular pot in there because of damage it could cause. but I was pleasantly surprised I was able to put it in this oven If you own a lower wattage microwave oven and you purchase this one. you will also need to adjust your times by at least half the amount you already use on your current oven. I also love the minute plus setting, if you make a mistake in your time you can press this button to add one more extra minute. everytime until you reach the desired time, it is very handy if you are not sure just how much more time you need with your cooking and don't want to have to go all through the steps again to reset and start over. this button is so easy. just one press and you get an extra minute. I completely recommend this Microwave oven ot everyone, I just hope it last twenty years like my old Amana microwave did.\"\n",

I am able to sleep and not wake up with a back achei did have to get new sheets though. thought i already had ones for deep pockets but they were not deep enough for this oneone tiny complaint i do have. it is harder to change the sheets. the material on the box spring and bottom of the mattress stick to each other instead of kind of sliding around and i wish the fabric on the boxspring was not so thin or fabric paper like. oh our older boxspring it was more like a waterproof tarp type material and not a single rip in it after ten years. this one came with a couple small tears in it so when i change the sheets have to lift the mattress up and move it around since it does not slide back into place at all. it is a softer bed just like it says plushso if you are looking for firm this is not going to be that bed for you.\"\n",
