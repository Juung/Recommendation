EZOn feature can be extended in 30 second increments just by pressing it. Custom Cook can be programmed to cook any single time you use the most often (my only complaint about this is you still need to press the Start/Enter button). Things to Remember never use a brillo pad or abrasive sponge on this as it could scratch very easily. although I don't know why you would want to, never turn the microwave oven on if nothing is inside it. when you first get it, sometimes it makes slight crackling sounds as it's in operation, these are normal when this arrives. it will look HUGE in the manufacturer's box, don't worry that's just how it looks in the box.

I was even able to put a Visions cookware pot in there without damaging the sides of the oven while the turntable is in motion which I thought I would not be able to do prior to receiving the oven. I did have a concern that I would not be able to use this particular pot in there because of damage it could cause. but I was pleasantly surprised I was able to put it in this oven If you own a lower wattage microwave oven and you purchase this one. you will also need to adjust your times by at least half the amount you already use on your current oven. I also love the minute plus setting, if you make a mistake in your time you can press this button to add one more extra minute. everytime until you reach the desired time, it is very handy if you are not sure just how much more time you need with your cooking and don't want to have to go all through the steps again to reset and start over. this button is so easy. just one press and you get an extra minute. I completely recommend this Microwave oven ot everyone, I just hope it last twenty years like my old Amana microwave did.\"\n",

    "        corrected = \"I have been sleeping on memory foam mattresses as soon as the knockoff ones were made. my parents and grandparents both have the expensive one that is advertised everywhere. but they have a larger budget than I do. .so I can tell you these mattresses are really evolving. that can be good and bad. technology can make things better for us, but sometimes things changing does not mean they are better. in fact sometimes they get worse. in this case, memory foam is evolving in a better way but the process to find the one for you is becoming more time consuming and frustrating. there are soooo many choices how do you know which foam is best?  1, 2 , 3 or 4 in?. gel infused?. regular foam?. 8,10 or 12 in?. I mean the choices are endless. and that is the part that gets to me. I spent nearly a total of 30 hours researching and comparing. and I know alot about these things. and it still took me that long. I can tell you my grandfather told me when I was a kid something I never forgot he said 'you spend 1/3 of your life sleeping, so you should make sure you find a good bed, it will help determine the quality of your life, health and happiness, so don't skimp on a good bed!'  He was right. but what is a good bed?  That is really up to each person. Here is what I did this time looking for a new mattress. 1.  Went to a mattress store.  Laid down on nearly all the mattresses and took notes.  I already knew I wanted a higher thickness like 12 inch, but I wanted to test the new gel infused beds, the latex beds and the expensive ones. then I tried the knockoffs. and wrote down my findings. I know sounds bizarre, but it works for me. it would not work for my husband he would just go in and buy the first one that felt good and we would have ended up spending nearly $2000.00 instead of $300.00. so that is why I go alone!!2.  I came home and did a search for 'what to know when buying a memory foam mattress.'  What this did is give me all the current information on the type of foams they are making now and what the specs are (what is the difference between a 3 inch and 4 inch foam?. what  is the difference between a 10 inch and 12 inch bed?. differences between densities of foam?). This them helped me determine that I wanted a bed to last longer than many beds, I need a firm bed for my back, hips, shoulders and knees, I wanted something that would keep the firmness yet provide support and be comfy. sounds like I wanted everything. oh yeah. and not break the bank!!. I learned that the higher the bed, the more likely it will last longer, the thicker the top layer of foam is with a density of at least 9, the longer the memory foam will stay firm. 3.  Now that I knew the type of bed I was looking for (firm, 12 inch height, 4 inch first layer of foam with a density of at least 9). .I went to Amazon to see what they had for sale. I found several. I then narrowed them down by price. from $200500. among these I looked at the reviews. and just because many people have purchased an item and it has several good reviews does not mean that is the best mattress. actually this one had the fewest people purchase it but the highest reviews out of those few people. so, now I had about 3 beds that me this criteria. 3.  I checked online in a search to find out the best memory foam mattresses consumer reports and other entities have put on the web, and found a few that matched up with the ones I had found on Amazon. .however, none of them matched up with this one. nearly all those other beds were higher in price, did not have the density I was looking for or were not 12 inches. 4.  So, out of all the beds, I had 3 to choose from, I looked on other sites to compare prices and I can tell you Amazon beats everyone hands down. even the big discount retailer (wally world). where I have purchased mattresses from before, did not compare to Amazon in terms of price or shipping time. .So why this mattress?. I can tell you that the 12 inch provides all the support I need and the longevity I am looking for. this mattress was one of the few on Amazon that actually states the density (which is critical to knowing how firm it really is). and I also checked the company's website to verify the firmness. and the 4 inch top layer with and ILD 9 (density). proved it was going to be firm and stay firm for years. my husband lives in a different state and his memory foam mattress is only a 3 inch and 7 ILD and we got it about 2 years ago and its starting to sag already. and he is not even a very big guy. so that will be the lst 3 inch 7 ILD that I buy. .AND as a BONUS. this mattress was only $254.99 on Amazon. with free shipping. I mean you just cannot beat it. most ILD 9 / 4 in. foam mattresses start at $500 and go way above. After this got delivered ahead of schedule, it came in rolled up in a large what appeared to be a duffle like bag.  Easy to open and immediately started taking shape.  I can tell you that nearly all my other mattresses have had the 'horrible' chemical smell for weeks after opening. but this one had about a day of it and it was gone. no more smell. that was nice. I did let it take shape for 3 days prior to sitting or laying on it. its important to do this so you do not impede on its taking full shape. if you lay on it too soon, you may see a sag in that part and it may never come to its full size. I know when you get something you want to use it right away. but you need to allow these to take full shape. it says 2 days, but I always allow for another full day. I would also recommend as others did, you open it up where you want it placed. once it has taken shape its not so easy to move unless you have help. and there are NO mattress handles on the side like other mattresses. Also, in terms of memory foam being 'hot' to sleep on. I sleep 'hot' myself and I have not noticed this is any hotter than any other mattress I have ever slept on. I have tshirt sheets and a thin blanket for summer, but I do not feel this gets hot at all. all memory foam will sink when it gets warm, but even by me sleeping 'hot' this one still stays firm. and its August so you know if it works in August, it will work in any other time of the year. August in Idaho is HOT!!!. .when I tried the gel infused mattresses or the ones that have multi layers with air cylinders that 'they claim will allow the foam to breathe better and air to flow through so you will not get so hot'. I found several places online that say that is just not true. and I did not notice any difference when I was trying out the beds at the stores. it is important that you have cotton sheets and cotton pillow cases because cotton is cooler than raymee, rayon, polyester, etc. I can ASSURE you. this is the BEST OF ALL MEMORY FOAM MATTRESSES I have EVER OWNED!!!. it is exactly what they say it is Firm yet soft. It provides ALL the support I need. yet it cradles you. I don't toss or turn, yet I don't sink either. great price. and quick shipping. NOT ALL MEMORY FOAM IS THE SAME. .so take the time to do the research for your own body. as I would never prescribe this bed for everyone, I know what I like and need, and this one is it for me!!. making sure you do your research BEFORE buying really pays off. Going to buy another for our camper. UPDATE 8/22/2013:  Someone asked me a question about the firmness of this mattress and the different weights of people. I can tell you I did respond in the comments section but I thought I would also put the response here. I weigh around 200 lbs and my husband less. so, I really needed a firm mattress for my body weight. if I lay on a bed that has no support I can tell you my hips, shoulders and back hurts like heck. so, this mattress fully supports me at my weight. some people that weigh less have complained in online reviews they feel the mattress is TOO FIRM. but my husband I believe weighs around 155 and he never has complained. he does have his own mattress (since he lives in Nebraska for work purposes and I live in Idaho). his mattress is not as dense of foam and that mattress is sinking already. he complains about his back hurting some mornings. he too likes a firm mattress. so when he visited me in Idaho last week and slept on this mattress, he thought it was GREAT!. even if he weighs less than me. as I said, he said too that this mattress even if its firm, its comfy. strange but true. I also wanted to point out an issue that I forgot in my initial posting. memory foam mattresses react different in different climates. for example. I have lived in Hawaii where the humidity is higher than it is in Idaho. and in a climate that is more humid the mattress will absorb that moisture and be less firm. this is why I felt its even more important to get a mattress with a higher density so it will stay firmer even in high humidity areas. I can tell you if I turn on my humidifier in Idaho, this particular mattress is NOT affected by the level of humidity. it still has remained firm yet comfy. again I believe this is due to the density of the top layer of foam. the higher the density the more firm it will remain. the less dense, the more it will allow moisture in and absorb it making it softer. .the last time I was in Nebraska visiting my husband and I slept on our older foam bed there, I woke up and thought my back was broken. I kid you not. I was miserable all day. its so humid back in Nebraska and the memory foam mattress he has is not as dense or thick. so it really absorbed the moisture in the air and was way too soft for me. I sank into it and my back suffered the entire next few days. the next night I slept on the couch and the firmness of the couch was better than the softness of the bed in that humid climate. STILL LOVIN THIS BED. ordering one for hubby soon and our camper!!!UPDATE 9/2/2013:COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Someone emailed me in the comment section and asked where this mattress was manufactured.  It says Country of Origin is China.  I would love to purchase USA products too, however, I learned years ago that even thought something says 'Made in the USA' it maybe put together here with materials from all over the world.  I did research beds that have been 'Certified' Made in the USA, and they either did not have the density of this mattress but were still way out of my price range.  I did also run into some of the Made in the USA mattresses that cannot guarantee the chemicals they spray on the mattress to be in compliance with the fire standards, come from the USA. so, I had to prioritize my wants and needs and what was most important to me was 1) comfort (being firm enough), 2) price and 3) as many nontoxic materials.  I did read a few people said there was not a horrible smell like other memory foam mattresses, and in my research, that is a good sign of fewer chemicals in the mattress. WARRANTY:  With respect to the warranty, I don't pay too much attention to those anymore, after the horror stories I learned about people trying to file a claim under a warranty. Not to mention the cost of returning it to the manufacturer is the buyers cost. That is why I wrote my initial posting, it really is all about the denseness of the foam. The more dense the foam the longer it will last. irrespective of the warranty. UPDATE 2/21/2014:We purchased another one of these for my husband who lives temporarily in the midwest for work.  Its very humid where he lives.  We have not noticed any difference in the mattress even with it being in a more humid climate in the midwest.  We are still very happy with these mattresses. I would remind those people looking to purchase or those who have purchased one prior, to make sure you place this mattress on a firm foundation/box spring.  They are not made to sit atop something that is not firm.  We did not have access to our boxspring one night and we placed this on top of another (spring) mattress so we did not have it on the floor directly.  However, after just a few hours, we noticed a significant difference in the firmness of the mattress. It became uneven and we sank into it.  Once we put it on the floor directly, it was fine and firm again. Also, we took off the cover and washed it.  It really washed up nicely.  I had one mattress before that when I dried the cover in the dryer, it shrank so small that I could not get it to fit the mattress anymore.  This cover did NOT do that.  It stayed the same size and went back on easy.\"\n",

      "Be warned: this is a LONG review (didn't realize HOW long when I first wrote it!), since I tried to hit all the main points of the Kaldi, but I'm hoping the surplus of info on each point proves helpful! Update I recently discovered that my local bed bath and beyond now carries these capsules (Virginia Peninsula region), which clearly makes it much easier to restock my favorite flavors. I was also happy to see that the capsules now include at least three new flavors: Hazelnut (regular and decaf), Butterscotch Toffee, and French Vanilla, all three being mildstrength flavored coffees. Additionally, I saw that the packaging has been changed on the French Vanilla and Dutch Cocoa powders, indicating to me that CBTL intends to continue to make these available, and push this product line. I consider that to be a GOOD thing, since this machine and the products that go with it provide a nice variety of hot beverage flavors!The CBTL Kaldi is the first singlecup brewer that I've owned from the new crop of singlecup brewers. I'd previously been using a Phillips Senseo machine with a few refillable pods that I bought here on Amazon, and loved. Being able to use my favorite coffee in those pods was great. The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf does, however, give Kaldi users plenty of options with this new addition to the current crop of highquality single brewers on the market. The coffee brewer has a small footprint, and a good, solid weight to it, even though it seems to be made of a heavy weight plastic. The platform on which the mug/espresso cup is meant to be placed is stamped metal, and can be flipped to bring a tiny espresso cup closer to the stream of coffee that is emitted from the front of the machine. Turning the platform over allows for about another 3/4 of an inch of depth  better for a standard mug, but not anywhere near enough clearance for the mondo mugs that have become so commonplace in today's world of coffee consumption. The one mug I use with my Kaldi fits perfectly. That mug's capacity is about 12 oz, stands about 4\" tall, and is about 3\" wide. None of my other mugs would fit under the spout, which I do consider to be a bit of a shortcoming of the Kaldi, but not a dealbreaker. The coffee itself that is brewed by the Kaldi is really very good, and very freshtasting. Unlike just about every other cup of coffee that I've brewed from nonencapsulated coffee, I really haven't noticed any issues with stomach upset due to acids from the coffee packaged in the Kaldi capsules. Maybe that's because of the tiny plastic filter inside each capsule, or it's the seal on the capsule (which keeps the capsule contents super fresh). Either way, you'll get no complaints from me about the freshness and lack of acid in my Kaldi cup o' Joe. I do, however, find the need to brew up a doubleserving of coffee with the Kaldi in order to get a large enough cup of Joe to satisfy my workday needs. At a minimum of $1.20, with each capsule approximating $.60 before shipping from the CBTL website, that can start to add up. Being on the East Coast, I don't remember ever seeing any Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf stores in my area, nor do the capsules seem to be carried yet in the stores, but both Amazon and the CBTL website carry them as of right now. Since I take my mug on the go with me to drink on the drive to work, after adding half & half from the fridge, my coffee is not warm enough for my tastes, so I nuke it for just under a minute, then head out. I noticed another reviewer mentioned that the temperature of the coffee is adjustable; the only thing mentioned about temperature in the manual is in the troubleshooting section, where it simply suggests that you heat the mug yourself if you want your coffee hotter, so the temperature of the brews is NOT adjustable, but I do like that you CAN adjust the quantity of water added to your cup. Also, I didn't have any difficulty with coffee spraying everywhere during my brewing cycles, nor did I have difficulties with especially long postbrewing drip, as mentioned in a different review. I've started to flush the system after just about every cup brewed, as another reviewer suggested, since I want my cups of brewed beverage to taste only like what I just brewed, not what was brewed last night. Also, speaking of flavor preservation, CBTL obviously felt it necessary to add a tank filter after their initial release of the Kaldi brewer, which I'm appreciative that they did. My filter was placed just inside the box, in a small plastic bag stapled to a card, and isn't even mentioned in the manual that comes with the brewer, so it's clear to me that it was an afterthought. And, as others have said, it DID occur to me immediately that anyone with less diminutive hands than mine would've had a harder time getting it in and attached to the bottom of the 40 oz water reservoir. Perhaps no one that's reviewed the Kaldi HAS had difficulty, but I thought it might be a problem, so just keep in mind that you may need some kitchen tongs or something to grip your filter and push it into place at the bottom of the tank. Overall, I really appreciate the wide variety of coffees, teas, and other beverage options available for this machine, even if I WILL have to be sure to order replacements before running out of my current stock. With fourteen options to choose from, you really can't complain too much about variety, so long as you don't already have your heart (or at least taste buds) firmly set on a specific brand/blend of the above. The available blends are as follows:Espressos (mildest to strongest):CBTL Continental Espresso Capsules By The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, 10Count Box (Pack of 3)Premium Decaf Espresso Capsules (also available on Amazon, but I've deleted the link to stay within review boundaries)CBTL Premium Espresso Capsules By The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, 10Count Box (Pack of 3)CBTL Italian Espresso Capsules By The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, 10Count Box (Pack of 3)Coffees (mildest to strongest):House Brew DECAF Coffee Capsules (also available on Amazon)CBTL House Brew Coffee Capsules By The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, 10Count Box (Pack of 3)CBTL Viennese Brew Coffee Capsules By The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, 10Count Box (Pack of 3)CBTL French Brew Coffee Capsules By The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, 10Count Box (Pack of 3)Teas:CBTL Moroccan Mint Tea Capsules By The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, 10Count Box (Pack of 3)CBTL English Breakfast Tea Capsules By The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, 10Count Box (Pack of 3)CBTL Tropical Passion Tea Capsules By The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, 10Count Box (Pack of 3)CBTL Chai Tea Capsules By The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, 10Count Box (Pack of 3)Powder Sachets (add to coffee to make it Cafe' Mocha or Cafe' Latte, to teas for a flavor shot with powdered creamer, or simply to warmed or frothed milk for hot chocolate or hot vanilla):The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf Chocolate Powder, 22Ounce Containers (Pack of 3) (not the sachets, but the same product, loose)or French Deluxe Vanilla (the only flavor not currently showing as available here on Amazon).If you're going to use this bundle for your hot chocolate or hot vanilla (if you will), the milk frother will come in very handy for that. The nonstick lining of the frother has demarcations for simple warmed milk or frothed milk. Keep in mind that frothed milk will have air whipped into it via the small wire whisk attached to the cover of the frother (increasing the volume of the added liquid), and simply fill the frother to the lower of the \"full capacity\" lines. A button push and ninety seconds later, you've got warm, frothy milk that's either perfect for adding to your coffee or tea, or ready to pour into your mug, to which you add one of the powder sachets for your chosen hot beverage. I haven't tried a hot vanilla yet, but the hot chocolate was very good, and very satisfying. Not necessarily better than other hot chocolates that I've had, but still, very tasty. I easily washed out the small amount of milk that was scalded to the lining, and my frother was ready for the next batch of milk. The tiny whisk is not difficult to detach if you simply want your milk warmed, but I'm concerned that the plastic base to it will wear out after too many attempts at removal and replacement of the whisk from its stem... Only time will tell if my concerns are founded. CBTL currently prices the powder sachets at $8.50 per box of eight. Capsules are $6.00 for a box of ten capsules. Not bad compared to the options for other singlecup brewers out there, but with limited local availability, and no free shipping visible from the CBTL website, your best bet is to place a big order and stock up once you've decided which of the flavors you like best from this bundle on Amazon. And, as a side note, unlike the Kaldi pictured, the model that I got is actually the blue one, which is a nice, middleofthe road shade of soft slate blue. With all that you get in this bundle on Amazon, you're saving quite a large amount of money compared to pricing other places. The machine itself prices at about $150. Tack on another $60 for the milk frother, then an additional 72 capsules at approximately $46, and you're looking at a bundle worth over $250, and that's not even including the cost of the wooden storage chest (which I didn't receive, but the closest approximation is the small capsule holder on the CBTL site, at $7.95). It's a great deal for a very good, small footprint hot beverage brewer that will easily give the other single cup brewers out there a run for their makers' money! Update  On my most recent visit to California, I tried finding the Kaldi capsules at two different The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf locations, with no luck. One of those locations WAS a smaller CBTL location inside of a local grocery store, but the other location that I visited was a standalone store that didn't stock any Kaldi capsules whatsoever, although each location DID stock the Cocoa and French Vanilla powders. Luckily, Amazon is now carrying the capsules, and at a good price. As is, the prices aren't much higher than you'll find on the CBTL website itself, so if you had to get them shipped from the CBTL website, with shipping costs, you'd still pay at least a little less here for them. If you opt for the Subscribe & Save feature that Amazon offers, you'll get the capsules for an additional 15% off, AND free shipping. Even though the Subscribe & Save price changes depending on product pricing the day of your order, and your Prime Free 2 day shipping upgrade won't apply, free standard shipping and 15% off saves you over the CBTL website's pricing.\n",
